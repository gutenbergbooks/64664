<span class="fs70">(BUFFALO BILL).</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is now some generations since Josh Billings, Ned
Buntline, and Colonel Prentiss Ingraham, intimate friends
of Colonel William F. Cody, used to forgather in the
office of Francis S. Smith, then proprietor of the <cite>New
York Weekly</cite>. It was a dingy little office on Rose Street,
New York, but the breath of the great outdoors stirred
there when these old-timers got together. As a result of
these conversations, Colonel Ingraham and Ned Buntline
began to write of the adventures of Buffalo Bill
for Street &amp; Smith.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody was born in Scott County, Iowa, February
26, 1846. Before he had reached his teens, his
father, Isaac Cody, with his mother and two sisters,
migrated to Kansas, which at that time was little more
than a wilderness.</p>

<p>When the elder Cody was killed shortly afterward in
the Kansas “Border War,” young Bill assumed the difficult
rôle of family breadwinner. During 1860, and until
the outbreak of the Civil War, Cody lived the arduous
life of a pony-express rider. Cody volunteered his services
as government scout and guide and served throughout
the Civil War with Generals McNeil and A. J.
Smith. He was a distinguished member of the Seventh
Kansas Cavalry.</p>

<p>During the Civil War, while riding through the streets
of St. Louis, Cody rescued a frightened schoolgirl from
a band of annoyers. In true romantic style, Cody and
Louisa Federci, the girl, were married March 6, 1866.</p>

<p>In 1867 Cody was employed to furnish a specified
amount of buffalo meat to the construction men at work
on the Kansas Pacific Railroad. It was in this period
that he received the sobriquet “Buffalo Bill.”</p>

<p>In 1868 and for four years thereafter Colonel Cody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
served as scout and guide in campaigns against the Sioux
and Cheyenne Indians. It was General Sheridan who
conferred on Cody the honor of chief of scouts of the
command.</p>

<p>After completing a period of service in the Nebraska
legislature, Cody joined the Fifth Cavalry in 1876, and
was again appointed chief of scouts.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody’s fame had reached the East long before,
and a great many New Yorkers went out to see
him and join in his buffalo hunts, including such men
as August Belmont, James Gordon Bennett, Anson
Stager, and J. G. Heckscher. In entertaining these
visitors at Fort McPherson, Cody was accustomed to
arrange wild-West exhibitions. In return his friends
invited him to visit New York. It was upon seeing his
first play in the metropolis that Cody conceived the idea
of going into the show business.</p>

<p>Assisted by Ned Buntline, novelist, and Colonel Ingraham,
he started his “Wild West” show, which later
developed and expanded into “<ins class="corr" id="tn2" title="Transcriber’s Note—“A Congress of the Rough-riders” changed to “A Congress of the Rough Riders”.">A Congress of the Rough Riders</ins>
of the World,” first presented at Omaha, Nebraska.
In time it became a familiar yearly entertainment
in the great cities of this country and Europe.
Many famous personages attended the performances, and
became his warm friends, including Mr. Gladstone, the
Marquis of Lorne, King Edward, Queen Victoria, and
the Prince of Wales, now King of England.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Sioux, in 1890 and 1891,
Colonel Cody served at the head of the Nebraska National
Guard. In 1895 Cody took up the development
of Wyoming Valley by introducing irrigation. Not long
afterward he became judge advocate general of the
Wyoming National Guard.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody (Buffalo Bill) died in Denver, Colorado,
on January 10, 1917. His legacy to a grateful world was
a large share in the development of the West, and a
multitude of achievements in horsemanship, marksmanship,
and endurance that will live for ages. His life
will continue to be a leading example of the manliness,
courage, and devotion to duty that belonged to a picturesque
phase of American life now passed, like the great

<span class="fs70">PIZEN KATE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The ungainly female who came roaring into Eldorado
in search of the husband who “run away”
from her contrived to draw a crowd about her in a remarkably
short time.</p>

<p>“I’m Pizen Kate, from Kansas City!” she yelled.
“Git out of my way, er I’ll jab yer eye out with my
umbreller. I’m lookin’ fer my husband, and you ain’t
him. Think I’d take up with a weasel-faced, bow-legged
speciment like you? Not on your tintype. I
wouldn’t! So, git out o’ my way!”</p>

<p>The man had tried to “chaff” her and had roused
her ire, but he fell back before the angry jabs of her
“umbreller.”</p>

<p>She looked about, glaring.</p>

<p>She was “homely as sin.” Her features were not
only irregular; they were twisted, gnarled, and seamed.
A few thin hairs of an attempted beard floated from
a mole on her chin, and on her upper lip there was a
faint trace of a mustache. She was dressed in a soiled
cotton garment, and on her head was a shapeless hat,
with a faded red rose for ornament. In her muscular
right hand she flourished an ancient umbrella.</p>

<p>“I heard my husband had come here, and I’m lookin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
fer him,” she declared. “He run away from me
in Kansas City, and I set out to foller him; and I’ll
foller him to the end o’ the earth but that I git him.”</p>

<p>“I’m bettin’ on you, all right!” called out some
irreverent individual.</p>

<p>She fixed him with a glassy stare.</p>

<p>“Was I ’specially directin’ my langwidge to you?”
she demanded. “I hate to hear a horse bray out that
way. It’s sickenin’.”</p>

<p>“And I hate to hear the blather of a nanny goat!”</p>

<p>She lifted her umbrella.</p>

<p>“Say that ag’in, you red-headed son of a scarecrow,
and I’ll ram this umbreller down yer neck and open it
up inside of ye! I’d have you know that I’m a lady,
and don’t allow no back talk.”</p>

<p>“What kind o’ lookin’ feller is your husband?” another
asked.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s better-lookin’ than them that slanders
him, if he is little and runty! He’s a small man, slim
as a blacksnake, and wiry as a watch spring, and he’s
a bit oldish. He was in this town less’n a week ago.”</p>

<p>“Kate, I reckon we ain’t met up with him.”</p>

<p>“Wot’s his name?” said another.</p>

<p>“What’s that got to do with it, if ye ain’t seen him?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>She fixed her eyes on a man who had, a moment before,
descended the steps of the Golconda Hotel, and
who came now toward the crowd that hedged her in.</p>

<p>The man was Buffalo Bill; handsome, muscular,
dressed in his border costume, and towering a full
head over the other men in the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

<p>“That’s him, I reckon, Katie&mdash;there comes yer husband,
I’m bettin’. You said he was little and runty,
slim as a blacksnake, and wiry as a watch spring. I
guess you hit his trail here, all right.”</p>

<p>It was the sort of humor this crowd could understand,
and they roared hilariously.</p>

<p>Pizen Kate ignored them with fine scorn, and
moved toward the great scout, the men falling back
before her jabbing umbrella and giving her ample
room. She pranced thus up in front of Buffalo Bill,
and stood eying him, umbrella in one hand and the
other hand on her hip.</p>

<p>“I think I seen you onct,” she announced, as the
scout politely lifted his big hat to her.</p>

<p>“Possibly,” he said, smiling.</p>

<p>“You’re Persimmon Pete, the gazeboo what run
away with my old man.”</p>

<p>The crowd snickered, and then roared again.</p>

<p>“Hardly,” said Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know ye!” was her vociferous assertion.
“You come to Kansas City with an Injun medicine
company, and lectured and sold medicine. And my
old man went to your show and seen ye; and then he
got magnetized by ye, somehow, and wandered off
after you when you went away. He was dead gone
on big men. I suppose that was because he was so
durn little and runty himself. It made him like big
men. And so he follered you off when you left town.
Now, ain’t that so? I know ye. You’re Persimmon
Pete.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span></p>

<p>The scout lifted his hat again, flushing slightly, for
he heard the roars of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said amiably, “I must deny the gentle
insinuation. I never saw your husband, nor Persimmon
Pete.”</p>

<p>“You deny it?” she shrieked.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I am compelled to doubt your word.”</p>

<p>“And you never seen my man?”</p>

<p>“I assure you that I never had that pleasure. What
is his name?”</p>

<p>“If you’re goin’ to start in by lyin’, it don’t make
no difference what his name is!” she declared.</p>

<p>“It might help in his identification,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Well, then, it’s Nicholas Nomad.” She faced
toward the snickering crowd. “Now laugh!” she
yelled. “It’s his name, and it fits him; fer if he ain’t
about next to no man I dunno it. Think of him leavin’
me in the suds there in&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Was ye washin’?” some one yelled.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I was, though how you know it I can’t
guess. I was washin’ that day fer Mrs. McGinniss
and her six children, and so I had to stay at home and
couldn’t watch him. He took advantage of it and
skun out. But I’ll git him yit, and when I do&mdash;&mdash;”
She shook her red fist at the crowd.</p>

<p>“You’ll wallop him?”</p>

<p>“Wallop him? He’ll think he’s been mixed up in a
barbed-wire cyclone; I won’t leave an inch of hide
on him.” She turned back to Buffalo Bill. “Ye ain’t
seen him, you’re sure?” she said anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say that I haven’t, madam.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<p>“You ain’t lyin’ to me?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>She gave him a fierce glare, and then turned to hurl
back some words of defiance to the shouting and laughing
crowd.</p>

<p>“Don’t git too clost to me!” she warned. “I’m a
lady, and I won’t stand it.”</p>

<p>Then she moved on up the street, looking for her
husband, the crowd of amused men and boys streaming
after her. Buffalo Bill followed her movements
with an amused smile.</p>

<p>“Cody,” said the hotel clerk, who had come down
into the street, “I’ve seen all sorts of females in my
day, but she takes the cake.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill laughed and turned back toward the
hotel.</p>

<p>“A bit peculiar, to say the least,” he agreed. “I
don’t think I ever saw another just like her. But
we’re likely to meet all kinds of queer characters out
here in the West.”</p>

<span class="fs70">READY TO GO.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The man whom Buffalo Bill had come to Eldorado
to meet appeared in the town some time after this
spectacular entrance of Pizen Kate, and sought the
famous scout, in the latter’s room at the hotel.</p>

<p>The name of this man was John Latimer. He lived
in isolated grandeur in a big house on Crested Mesa,
for the benefit of his health, he said, which had been
weakened by the damp and trying climate of the East.</p>

<p>He was an elderly man, of impressive appearance;
gray-haired and gray-bearded. His eyes were gray,
and were overhung by bushy gray eyebrows. He
dressed neatly, in the Eastern fashion, and seemed
very much out of place in this wild border country, at
that time.</p>

<p>These things Buffalo Bill noted, as John Latimer
came into the room, shook hands, and took the chair
placed for him.</p>

<p>“Ah, Cody!” he said. “I was afraid you wouldn’t
come, even though I had made my complaint so
strong.”</p>

<p>“Your appeals stirred the colonel of the regiment
at Fort Sinclair, and he told me to come out here and
look into the thing and report to him at once; and he
gave me authority, likewise, to send for a company of
men, or even to organize a company of border riflemen
on my own account, for quick action, if I thought necessary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p>“Very good!” said Latimer. “That pleases me.
You shall have all the proofs you want.”</p>

<p>“I’ve already been getting some of them, on my
way here.”</p>

<p>“You heard of that last raid made by the road
agents on the Double Bar Ranch?” said Latimer.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And the attack of the Redskin Rovers on the
treasure train which a week ago came out of the Bighorn
Hills?”</p>

<p>“I heard of that, too. You have means of knowing
something of the movements of these men?”</p>

<p>“Very little. The Redskin Rovers puzzle me.”</p>

<p>“Are they really Indians, or are they white men
disguised as Indians?”</p>

<p>“Genuine Indians, I think.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps led by white men?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t troubled you lately?”</p>

<p>“Not lately.”</p>

<p>“Nor the white road agents?”</p>

<p>“They shot one of my herders less than a week ago.
I believe they thought him a miner with gold. He
was dressed somewhat like a miner, and he was coming
out of the hills with filled saddle pouches. But the
pouches held only some mineral specimens I had asked
him to get for me. That trip cost him his life, poor
fellow.”</p>

<p>“You know where that place is? We can, perhaps,
find their trail there even yet.”</p>

<p>“You are ready to go with me, Cody?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what I came for.”</p>

<p>“And I came in to get you and take you out to my
place.”</p>

<p>“You spoke of your herder. Are you running a cattle
ranch?”</p>

<p>“Not a ranch; but I keep a few, a very few, cattle.
I am living there simply for the benefit of my health.”</p>

<p>His clear skin, the breadth of his shoulders, his
general look of good health, in spite of gray hairs and
gray beard, did not indicate that his health needed any
especial care, as the scout noted.</p>

<p>“When will you go, Cody?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Any time. Now, if you like.”</p>

<p>“Now it is, then. We’ll start as soon as you can
get ready.”</p>

<p>“I am ready.”</p>

<p>They left the room together.</p>

<p>In the hotel office Buffalo Bill ordered his horse
brought from the stable and made ready for him, and
he paid his score. Latimer’s horse had been left in
the street in front of the hotel, tied to a hitching post.
In a little while the scout and Latimer were mounted;
and they galloped together out of the town of Eldorado,
drawing many remarks from those who saw
them go.</p>

<p>One of the witnesses of their departure was Pizen
Kate. She had been having a dispute with a German
shoemaker, who declared he had seen her missing husband
the week before, and that he had but one leg, a
statement that Pizen Kate disputed so warmly that
the German was willing to modify it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p>“Vell, he mighd haf had two legs,” he admitted,
“but one of dem vas of wood. He come py my shop
in, and ven he put oop his foot here, to have me fix
his shoe, he say he is no man, as he haf but one leg.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t say he was Nicholas Nomad! He
didn’t say that?”</p>

<p>“No; I didn’t ask him vat vas his first name.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the German was a bit of a joker, for when
he said this his blue eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>Pizen Kate stopped her wordy and interesting dispute
with him, and stared at the horsemen who went
by&mdash;Buffalo Bill and John Latimer.</p>

<p>“You know them men?” she snapped.</p>

<p>“Neider uff dhem vas the man vat I see. Neider of
dhem vas your hoosbant.”</p>

<p>“Who said they was?” she snapped. “I said did
you know ’em?”</p>

<p>“One I haf seen pefore. But I ton’d know heem.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean Buffalo Bill, the tallest of ’em?”</p>

<p>“No; I ton’d know him. I neffer haf seen him.
Bud I t’ink me I voult like to haf dhe chob uff making
his poots for him. Dey musd cost apout dwendy-five
tollars a pair.”</p>

<p>She left him in a hurry.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to find out why them two fellers aire
ridin’ out of this place so fast,” she threw back at
him. “It looks curious. I wonder if they don’t know
somethin’ about my missin’ husband? Huntin’ fer
missin’ husbands is terrible tryin’ work.”</p>

<span class="fs70">AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Buffalo Bill arrived with Latimer at the
home of the latter on the Crested Mesa, he found a
big, rambling building, with many wings, together
with a number of other buildings and stables. Close
by flowed a stream of water between high and rocky
banks, where, Latimer said, his few cattle obtained
their water. The place looked deserted.</p>

<p>But a great surprise came to the scout when, on
riding up to the big house, he was about to dismount,
and a servant came rushing out to take the horses.
He stared, open-mouthed, hanging half out of his
saddle, for when his eyes fell on this servant he had
been swinging to the ground, and that sight had
stopped all movement on his part for an instant.</p>

<p>The servant was a wizened little man, with a wide
mouth and small, peering eyes. He was dressed in
a half-border manner, and a revolver was belted to
his waist.</p>

<p>“Nick Nomad!” was the name that came from the
scout’s lips.</p>

<p>Old Nick Nomad seemed as much taken aback as
Buffalo Bill. He halted in confusion; then laughed in
his quaint cackling manner, and advanced toward the
horse.</p>

<p>“Yours to command, Buffler!” he cried, spreading
his homely mouth in a huge grin. “You didn’t reckon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
on seein’ me, and I didn’t reckon on seein’ you, and
so we’re both properly astonished. But I ain’t a-goin’
to hold it agin’ ye.”</p>

<p>The scout swung to the ground, and seized the little
man by the hand, shaking the hand warmly.</p>

<p>“Nomad, I am glad to see you!”</p>

<p>“Ther same hyar, Buffler! I’m as glad to see ye
as if I’d run a splinter in my foot. What ye doin’
hyar?”</p>

<p>“What are <em>you</em> doing here?”</p>

<p>“Me? Waal, I’m in hard luck jes’ now, fer a fac’.
And so I’ve become a sort of hostler hyar, ye see.
I look after ther hosses, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>John Latimer was looking on in surprise, and the
garrulous old trapper subsided, seeing it.</p>

<p>“I’ll have a long talk with you later,” said the scout.
“I’m the guest of Mr. Latimer, and shall probably
be out here several days. By the way, Nomad, what
do you know of Indians and road agents?”</p>

<p>“They’re all dead, so fur’s I know, Buffler.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen any lately?”</p>

<p>“Nary a pesky red, an’ not a single pizen road
agent.”</p>

<p>“That’s strange. Mr. Latimer has reported that he
had lately been raided by road agents and by the Redskin
Rovers?”</p>

<p>“Waal, ye see how ’tis, Cody. I only come hyar
yistiddy, and so I can’t be considered as bein’ ’specially
up in ther happenin’s hyar and hyarabouts. But if
thar’s road agents and Injuns floatin’ round, I’ll begin
to feel that I’ve arrove ahead o’ time in ther happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
huntin’ grounds. I ain’t hed no good times at all,
sense the days when you and me was huntin’ Injuns
and road agents together.”</p>

<p>The scout, though anxious for a talk with old Nick
Nomad, saw that John Latimer had dismounted and
was waiting to accompany him into the house.</p>

<p>“Well, take my horse, Nomad,” he said. “By the
way, Nick, where is old Nebuchadnezzar.”</p>

<p>A whinny came from the nearest stable; and old
Nomad, hearing it, bent double with cackling laughter,
so pleased was he.</p>

<p>“Thar he is, Buffler, ther ole sinner! He knows his
name as well as some men know the name o’ whisky,
and he answers jes’ as quick. He heard ye say ‘Nebbycudnezzar’
and he answers ye! How long’s it been,
Buffler, sense that wise critter heerd your gentle voice,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>“More than a year, I think.”</p>

<p>“Jes’ ther same, he’s rec’nized it. Buffler, I’ve seen
wise hosses in my time, but Nebby goes ahead of ther
best of ’em. He’s a-gittin’ so knowin’ that I’m acchilly
askeered that some mornin’ I’ll wake up and find that
he’s been translated to ther hoss heaven, if thar is
one.”</p>

<p>Having started on his favorite subject, old Nick
Nomad would have gone on indefinitely, if Buffalo
Bill had not snapped one of his sentences in the middle
by practically deserting him and entering the house
with Latimer.</p>

<p>The thing that first arrested Buffalo Bill’s attention
within the house was that the big, rambling structure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
was apparently without occupants. One servant had
come to the door, to admit them&mdash;a Mexican of villainous
aspect and slinking mien&mdash;but aside from this
one Mexican not another soul was to be seen.</p>

<p>“You appear to be quite alone here?” the scout
suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Latimer admitted, “quite alone.”</p>

<p>“You have been here alone from the first?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have had a number of servants, but none
of them remained with me long. The place is too isolated,
and too far from the towns. So, after a short
time, in each instance, they departed. I have now
only that Mexican, and the man you talked with. You
seemed to know him, Cody? He came to me only yesterday.
He’s a stranger to me, and may not be reliable;
but I needed help so badly that I took him
without asking him any questions.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing mysterious about him,” the scout
replied, as he passed through the long hall with Latimer
to the latter’s rooms. “He is, in fact, as open as
the day.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure I’m glad to hear it,” Latimer confessed,
with an appearance of uneasiness. “I have
more than once suspected that servants who have been
here have been in alliance with the Redskin Rovers, or
the road agents.”</p>

<p>“Nomad is an old-trapper, who has been in the
Western mountains more years than he can remember;
and yet, in spite of the great age he claims&mdash;hear
him tell it sometimes and you’d be ready to believe him
a hundred years old&mdash;he is as spry as a young man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and as a dead shot with rifle or revolver he has not
many equals. He has helped me in a number of scouting
trips, and we’ve had some very interesting experiences
together. It surprised me to find him here.”</p>

<p>“Surprised you?”</p>

<p>“That he should be doing menial work. But he explained
that he found himself in hard luck, and was
glad to take anything that offered. I was glad to see
him. He is as a friend true as steel.”</p>

<p>When they passed into the large rooms Latimer
apologized for their apparent disorder.</p>

<p>“You perhaps heard him boasting of his horse,” the
scout continued, still speaking of Nick Nomad.</p>

<p>“A bag of bones, Cody!” cried Latimer. “I wonder
the brute can carry him.”</p>

<p>“Yet a wonderful horse. According to Nomad, it
is the most wonderful horse in America, or in the
world. And it really is a beast of rare intelligence.
He has so trained it that its actions at times seem almost
human.”</p>

<p>“My new hostler seems to be rather a wonderful
man,” remarked Latimer, with a dry smile. “I shall
have to have a talk with him myself.”</p>

<p>“You will find that he is a wonderful man, if you
ever are able to know him as thoroughly as I do,” was
the scout’s answer.</p>

<span class="fs70">PIZEN KATE FINDS HER HUSBAND.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buffalo Bill had not been in the lonesome house on
the big mesa an hour before he heard a roaring shout
near the stables. It drew him to the open window,
and when he looked out he beheld Pizen Kate.</p>

<p>She had sighted Nick Nomad, and was making for
him, waving her big umbrella round her head as if it
were a lasso with which she meant to effect his capture.</p>

<p>“Run away from me, will ye?” she was bellowing.
“Abandon me, yer lawful and lovin’ wedded wife, will
ye? Well, you’ll perceive the sinfulness of yer sinful
ways before I git through with you, you bet! You’ll
know fer certain that I’m Pizen Kate, of Kansas
City, and a lady that’s not to be trifled with.”</p>

<p>For a moment Buffalo Bill was too astonished for
mirth; then he broke into a roar of laughter. Leaving
the window, he descended quickly to the ground,
and made his way out to where Pizen Kate was
tongue-lashing her recreant spouse. She was still at
it when the scout arrived.</p>

<p>“Me washin’ fer you, and laborin’ fer you; and
then you cuttin’ right out and runnin’ away from me!
Is that the way fer a man to conduct himself toward
the wife of his bosom? Answer me that, you dried-up
mummy, you pestiferous weasel! Why don’t you
answer me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span></p>

<p>Nomad had backed into a corner of the adobe wall
that formed part of the horse inclosure, and was defending
his face with his hands from the jabbing umbrella.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” he admitted.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t I a true and lovin’ wife to ye?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you run away from me when I was workin’
fer ye?”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” he pleaded. “Don’t hit me in ther face
with thet! Great snakes! Yes; I’m willin’ ter admit
ter anything. I’m all sorts of critters that ye can
think up, and more throwed in. But don’t poke me in
the eye with thet.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a notion to ram it down yer throat and open
it up inside of ye!” she threatened.</p>

<p>“Waal, it’d make me look fatter, ef ye did!” he declared.
“Hold on&mdash;hold on! Thet thar is my arm
you’re peelin’ the skin off of. Let up, can’t ye?”</p>

<p>“Why did you do it?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I ast you why did ye do it?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t live with ye, and that’s a fact!” he sputtered,
hopping about to evade her blows.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t live yith yer lovin’ and lawful wife?”</p>

<p>“You was too strenuous fer me, and yer temper was
too peppery. So I thought I’d slide.”</p>

<p>Latimer had appeared, drawn by the noise.</p>

<p>“And there’s the feller that you went away with!”
she said to Nomad. “Don’t say he ain’t, fer I know.
Thet’s ther dashin’ galoot that called hisself Persimmon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
Pete. You got stuck on him there in Kansas
City, and lit out with him. Don’t say it ain’t so, er
I’ll poke the p’int of this umbreller inter yer innards!
Don’t say it ain’t so!”</p>

<p>“Waugh! I ain’t sayin’ that it ain’t so.”</p>

<p>“Then it is so? I knowed it was. And he lied to
me in ther town, when I charged him with it. And
he knowed you was out here; and out here he rid, to
meet ye. I seen him go, and I follered him. Oh, I
understand ye! You can’t fool Pizen Kate. Ain’t
it so?”</p>

<p>“Anything’s so, when you says it is,” said Nomad.</p>

<p>She shook her umbrella at Buffalo Bill. “You lied
to me there in the town!” she vociferated. “You
said you wasn’t Persimmon Pete, and you perfessed
that you didn’t know nothing about where my ole man
was! Now, what do ye say to that? When you left
Eldorado I follered ye. And here I find you two together.
What do ye say to that? Answer me!”</p>

<p>The scout was laughing too much to reply as quickly
as she wished, and this made her rave the more.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” he said finally.</p>

<p>“You don’t know this man?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know him.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t my lawful, wedded husband?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that he isn’t, of course. It only surprises
me.”</p>

<p>“Surprises ye, does it? Well, when I think of it, it
surprises me, too. To think that I should ’a’ married
a walkin’ shadder of a man like that, a living mummy
that grins and acts like a baboon; and then that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
should run away frum me, when I stood ready to lavish
all my wifely love on him. Yes, it surprises me,
too.” She glared at the scout. “Why did you tell me
that you wasn’t Persimmon Pete?”</p>

<p>“Because I am not.”</p>

<p>“What!” she shrieked. “You deny it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t deny anything, Buffler!” wailed Nomad.
“It’ll be wuss fer ye. Admit everything she says. If
she asks me ain’t I the man in the moon, I’m saying
‘yes’ to her every time.”</p>

<p>“You are married to her?” said the scout.</p>

<p>“Waugh! Buffler, she made me do it!”</p>

<p>“If you ain’t Persimmon Pete,” she demanded of
the scout, “who aire ye?”</p>

<p>“My name is Cody. Sometimes I’m called Buffalo
Bill.”</p>

<p>“And that’s another lie!” she declared. “I know
ye. You’re Persimmon Pete. But I’ll tell ye now,
that I’m goin’ to take this man back with me, and
he’ll live with me as my lovin’ husband, er I’ll kill
him.”</p>

<p>Nomad contrived to escape out of his corner while
the infuriated woman talked with the scout and with
Latimer, and when he had accomplished that he
sprinted round the end of the wall.</p>

<p>She gave chase immediately; and when she found
that he had hid himself somewhere, she began to
search for him, vowing that she would not rest until
she had forced him to return with her to her home in
Kansas City. She repeated her threat, as she made
her furious search.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p>“If he don’t go back with me, and live with me as
my lovin’ husband, I’ll kill him. There ain’t goin’ to
be no pore-deceived-and-weepin’-woman business with
me now, you bet! I ain’t that kind of a hairpin! I’m
a woman that knows her rights and is willin’ to fight
fer ’em. And if he thinks he can hide, and that I’ll
soon go away and leave him, why, then he is mightily
mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Your hostler seems to have got into a good deal of
trouble,” the scout remarked to Latimer, as they returned
to the house together, leaving Pizen Kate hunting
for Nick Nomad.</p>

<p>“Cody,” said Latimer, “that is the most absurd
episode I ever saw, or knew about. I’m afraid that
new hostler is a great rascal, in spite of what you informed
me about him.”</p>

<p>A little later the scout saw Nomad running toward
the house. Pizen Kate was not in sight. Apparently,
Nomad had found a chance to get out of his hiding
place unobserved by her, and was making tracks for
the security of the big building.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill hurried through the hall and swung the
front door open to admit him.</p>

<p>“Cody, is she comin’?” Nomad panted.</p>

<p>The scout glanced out. “I think not.”</p>

<p>“Then, Cody,” he lowered his voice, “come into thet
room over thar, fer I want a talk with ye. Fasten
ther door, so that she can’t git in. And don’t let Latimer
know about it. Jes’ a few minutes’ talk with ye,
in thet room over thar.”</p>

<p>He ran on toward the door of the room indicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></p>

<p>The scout stayed, in obedience to his request, to bar
the outer door against the ferocious Pizen Kate. He
occupied but a minute of time in doing it, and then followed
on to the room, through whose door he had
seen Nomad vanish. But when he entered the room
Nomad was not there.</p>

<p>“Nomad!” he called, looking about.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<span class="fs70">MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Nick Nomad had disappeared with such a mystery
in the manner of his going that Buffalo Bill was bewildered.</p>

<p>The room into which Nomad had run was, apparently,
but an ordinary room, with no door but the
one he had gone through; and it had but one window,
which was closed and locked, and which, the scout was
absolutely sure, Nomad had not opened. Even a
casual examination of that window was enough to
show that Nomad would not have had time to open it
and get through it before the scout’s appearance; and
even if he could have succeeded in doing that, he could
not, from the outside, have locked it, for it was locked
from the inside.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill stood amazed and aghast when, after
much calling, he had no response, and after much examination
he could not solve the mystery.</p>

<p>The floor, the walls, the ceiling, were solid; the window
was closed tightly, and the one door had been in
sight, and Nomad had not come out by it. He had
gone into that room, and then had “evaporated.”</p>

<p>While the scout was still puzzling over this singular
thing, Pizen Kate appeared at the outer door of the
house, which she pushed open boldly, and entered.
Figuratively, there was blood in her eye, and she was
painted for the warpath. She looked suspiciously at
the scout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span></p>

<p>“Where is he?” she said. “He came in here! You
been helpin’ him?”</p>

<p>“Madam, I wish I knew.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you was here, you seen him, didn’t ye?
Where’d he go? Before I git through with him I’m
goin’ to l’arn him a few things, you bet! Run away
from me in Kansas City, he did&mdash;and jes’ now, when
I was lecturin’ him on the sin of his acts, he kited out
ag’in. He come in here, fer I seen him; but he outrun
me. Now, where is he?”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew.”</p>

<p>“Well, why <em>don’t</em> you know? Didn’t you see him
come in?”</p>

<p>“I did. He went into that room. I was to follow
him, for I wanted to have a talk with him; but when
I entered the room he was not in it. If you can find
him, or tell what became of him, I shall be obliged
to you, for I’m as anxious to know where he is as you
are.”</p>

<p>She gave him a stare of disbelief, then she walked
to the door and looked in.</p>

<p>“He ain’t in there,” she said, withdrawing her head,
“and he never was in there, and you know it. Playin’
with my feelin’s, aire ye? And me a pore, lone
woman! Well, now that’s what I’d expect of you,
Persimmon Pete, and nothin’ else. You’ve hid him
away, and aire laughin’ at me, thinkin’ it’s smart. But
you’ll find I ain’t a lady to be trifled with. I want my
husband.” She planted herself before the scout and
flourished her ancient umbrella. “I want my ondutiful
husband, and I want him this minute!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p>The scout was too anxious and too greatly mystified
to laugh.</p>

<p>“Madam, if I knew where he was, I shouldn’t turn
him over to your tender mercies, but I don’t know
where he is.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me he went into that room,
and then drapped out o’ sight?”</p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>She went to the door and looked in again.</p>

<p>“You used to tell some big lies, Persimmon Pete,
when you was sellin’ that Injun medicine, that you
said would cure about anything in creation; but you
must have been practicin’ some lately, fer that’s the
biggest lie that ever was told.”</p>

<p>“It looks it,” he admitted.</p>

<p>She glared at him in disbelief.</p>

<p>“I can’t stay to talk with you,” he added, “for I’m
going to call for Latimer. He may be able to explain
this thing. There must be a way out of that
room which I know nothing about and cannot discover.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” called Latimer.</p>

<p>“Will you be so good as to come here?” Cody
asked. “Here’s a mystery that is baffling and serious,
but you may be able to make it seem quite simple.”</p>

<p>Latimer came forward. “Yes?” he said questioningly.</p>

<p>“Nomad came into this hall but a little while ago.
He was hurrying, and as he came in he told me to
follow him into that room, as he wished a word with
me in private. I followed him to the door, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
on into the room; but he wasn’t there. He did not
come out by the door, for it was in my view all the
time, and he could not have gone out by the window
and left it locked on the inside, if he’d had time, which
he had not. Will you be so good as to point out what
other way he could have gone out of that room?”</p>

<p>Latimer hesitated.</p>

<p>“Will you step to the door and look in,” said the
scout.</p>

<p>John Latimer obeyed this, but when he turned about
his face showed agitation.</p>

<p>“It’s one of the mysteries of this strange place,” he
said, in a low voice. “All of my servants have disappeared
in just that way. For a while they are here
working around; then they are gone. I don’t know
what becomes of them. I get other servants, and they
likewise disappear.”</p>

<p>His manner was agitated. Buffalo Bill stood
aghast.</p>

<p>“Are you in sober earnest, Mr. Latimer?”</p>

<p>“Never more so,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Pizen Kate stared her disbelief, and then broke into
a cackle of spiteful laughter.</p>

<p>“Do ye think it’s nice,” she said, “for two men to
try to fool a pore, lone woman in that way? I found
my lawful and wedded husband here, after chasin’ him
all the way frum Kansas City. And you, sympathizin’
with him in his abandonment of me, his true and lovin’
wife, git up this kind of a yarn to keep me frum takin’
him back with me.”</p>

<p>John Latimer seemed hurt by the accusation. Buffalo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Bill strode again to the door, and then walked on
into the room. He began to sound the walls with the
butt of a revolver, and to sound the boards of the
floor with his heels. Latimer followed him to the
door.</p>

<p>Pizen Kate was still raving, accusing them of conspiring
to deprive her of her husband.</p>

<p>“Woman, will you stop that clatter?” cried Latimer,
whose nerves were jarred by her abusive talk.</p>

<p>“No, I will not!” she declared. “Not till I’ve found
that man, and had the law on you two men fer hidin’
him away from me. Do ye suppose I’m fool enough
to believe sich a story as you’re tellin’?”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill came out of the room baffled. “Have
these other disappearances been just in this way?” he
inquired of Latimer.</p>

<p>“Not in just that way, Cody. I’ve twice sent servants
on errands, from which they have never returned.
Once, a month ago, I had a servant girl at work in my
kitchen. I was in my own rooms. I heard her scream.
When I got to the kitchen there was not a soul in it,
and I have seen nothing of that girl since.”</p>

<p>Pizen Kate stared at him.</p>

<p>“You’re just tellin’ that to scare me away from
this place.”</p>

<p>“I’m telling you the truth.”</p>

<p>“You never saw anything strange yourself?” asked
the scout.</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“And you have formed no theory to account for
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>

<p>“I haven’t been able to, Cody.”</p>

<p>Pizen Kate walked into the room and began to look
it over.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a good deal of dealings with men,” she
said, as she came out, “and I know that you two fellers
aire lyin’. But if you think you kin scare Pizen
Kate that easy, then you don’t know her. I come here
huntin’ fer my lawful husband, and I’m goin’ to stay
till I find him.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill made now another inspection of the
mysterious room, and this time he was accompanied
in his examination of it by Latimer.</p>

<p>Pizen Kate stood in the door, keenly watching them,
and now and then sarcastically commenting.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill had never been more puzzled in his life
than when he gave up further search there as a useless
waste of time. He now commenced a thorough
search of the house, asking Latimer’s aid, while Pizen
Kate went to the outside, as if she thought she might
be in a better position to see there; for she doubtless
reasoned that if Nomad was still in the house, and
tried to get out of it, he could not easily do so and
escape her eyes.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill’s search was unavailing. Nick Nomad
was gone.</p>

<span class="fs70">INDIAN TREACHERY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Buffalo Bill gave up his profitless search and
came out of the house he saw a mounted Indian ride
up to the gate, some distance off, where he met John
Latimer. The Indian was a painted and plumed specimen
of his race, and, altogether, a glittering and
jaunty figure, as he sat on his mustang, talking with
Latimer.</p>

<p>Only a few words were said by the two men, and
then the Indian wheeled his mustang and galloped
away, his feathers flying, and the sun shining with
brilliant effect on his beaded garments and on the
painted spots on his horse.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill had emerged from the big house by a
side entrance. He hurried now round to the front,
where he expected to meet Latimer returning from
this talk with the redskin. Latimer had gone from
the gate in another way, however; and the scout did
not see him for several minutes, and then it was in
the house itself.</p>

<p>“What about that Indian, Latimer?” was his question.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn31" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Latimer stared blanky” changed to “Latimer stared blankly”.">Latimer stared blankly</ins>.
“What Indian?” he said.</p>

<p>“Why, the one you met out there by the gate a while
ago.”</p>

<p>“I have seen no Indian!” said Latimer.</p>

<p>The answer so took the scout aback that for a moment
he was at a loss what to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<p>“I am sure, Latimer, I saw you out by the gate
talking with a mounted Indian, not more than five
minutes ago. I had just got to the steps, on the east
side there, and saw the Indian ride up to the gate.
You were there, and you spoke with him, and then he
rode away.”</p>

<p>An angry look flashed over Latimer’s face.</p>

<p>“Cody,” he said quietly, “you are my guest here;
and, therefore, I shall not try to call you to account
for giving me the lie!”</p>

<p>“You mean that I did not see you out there talking
with an Indian?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Then, Latimer, I saw your very image and counterpart!”</p>

<p>“That may be, Cody. I can’t say as to that. You
did not see me.” Latimer’s manner was strangely
cold.</p>

<p>“You did not even know there was an Indian out
there?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“This is as strange as the singular disappearance
of my friend Nomad.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you are just a little given to
imaginings, Cody? Pardon the suggestion. You saw
your friend go into a room, which, according to your
own story, he could not have gone into and got out
of without your knowing it. And now you have seen
me talking with an Indian by the front gate, when all
the while I have been here in the house.”</p>

<p>A certain sense of giddy bewilderment attacked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
level-headed scout. Could he have been subject to
hallucinations? The very suggestion was enough to
give him a severe mental start.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” he said. “I was sure of those two
things. But if you say you were not out there, of
course I accept your statement. But I saw some one
there that I took to be you.”</p>

<p>Latimer laughed, and the frown vanished from his
face.</p>

<p>“That’s more like you, Cody! I have given you no
occasion to think I would lie about a matter of that
kind, or would have any occasion to deceive you.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” the scout admitted.</p>

<p>“There may have been no one out at the gate,”
Latimer urged.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill could not admit that, puzzled as he was.</p>

<p>To make sure that he had not been wholly the victim
of some optical delusion, as soon as he ceased talking
with Latimer he walked out to the gate, and there
scanned the ground, looking for tracks of the mustang.
While thus looking he heard his name called
by Pizen Kate.</p>

<p>A suggestion came to him.</p>

<p>“You didn’t see an Indian out here a while ago talking
with Latimer?” he asked her.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t lookin’,” she said noncommittally. “The
only thing I was lookin’ for was that no-’count husband
o’ mine, that’s run away from me ag’in. I can’t
find hide ner hair of him.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could,” said the scout, with much
earnestness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p>“Then you really don’t know what’s become of
him?” she queried.</p>

<p>“Not in the least.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t help him to git away?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought ye did, and I was good an’ mad!”</p>

<p>“You didn’t see an Indian here?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t, for I wasn’t lookin’.”</p>

<p>“Nor you didn’t see Latimer come from this gate
five minutes or more ago?”</p>

<p>“I tell ye, I <em>wasn’t lookin’</em>. Somethin’ queer about
this place,” she added suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to think so, too.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she declared, “they can’t fool with me!
Aire you goin’ to stay here long?”</p>

<p>“Until I discover what has become of Nomad.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m with ye! We’ll find him, if we have to
tar and feather that Latimer to make him tell what
he knows. I reckon I’ll go up to the house and give
him a few jabs in the ribs with this old umbreller, to
make him talk a bit.”</p>

<p>She marched angrily toward the house.</p>

<p>The scout began to look for the tracks of the mustang.
He found them in the dust close by the gate;
and on the other side of the gate he saw the imprint
of shoes, which he was sure had been made by John
Latimer.</p>

<p>“As Kate says, there is something mysterious here,”
was his thought, “and it begins to look as if John
Latimer were crooked. He lied to me when he said
he had not been down here by this gate, and he lied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
in saying he had not here met an Indian. I think I’ll
follow this trail. It may reveal something.”</p>

<p>The scout started off on the trail of the mustang;
and though, when he got away from the gate, other
horse trails interfered, he was yet so skillful that he
picked out that of the mustang from among them and
continued on, finding that it led toward the hills.</p>

<p>The house was out of sight, and he was on a long,
grassy level, when, looking up, he saw the Indian riding
slowly toward him. Only one look was needed to
show that this was the identical Indian who had been
at the gate. He seemed to be either returning toward
the house, or else, having seen that he was being followed,
he had ridden back to ascertain the meaning
of it.</p>

<p>“A word with you,” shouted Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>The Indian drew rein at a little distance, and sat
in silence, regarding the scout with distrust.</p>

<p>“You were up there at the gate a little while ago?”</p>

<p>The redskin did not answer.</p>

<p>“Tell me if that isn’t so, and if you didn’t talk
there at the gate with the man who lives in that
house?”</p>

<p>The question seemed to throw the redskin into an
unaccountable rage. He drove his mustang forward
without an instant’s warning, and, drawing a short
rawhide whip, he aimed a blow at the scout’s face.</p>

<p>Though the movement was so unexpected, the scout
was not caught napping. For as the enraged redskin
tried to ride Buffalo Bill down and strike him in the
eyes with the whip, the scout caught the mustang by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the head and nose, jerking its head round, and it went
over in a heap, as if shot. The thing was done so
quickly and cleverly that the Indian was thrown from
the mustang’s back; and his right foot got caught
under the falling horse.</p>

<p>The fall jarred a grunt from him; and then he tried
to pull his foot out, but the scout leaped toward him
now, drawing his revolver.</p>

<p>The horse had quivered as it fell, but now it lay
stretched out. It had struck on its head and neck
in its fall, and the weight of its body thus crushing
against it had broken its neck, killing it.</p>

<p>The Indian stared stupidly when he saw that revolver.</p>

<p>“White man no shoot!” he begged.</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to, unless you try treachery and
force me to,” was the answer, as Cody pointed the
pistol at the Indian’s feathered head. “Tell me why
you rode to the gate over there a while ago!” he
sternly commanded.</p>

<p>The redskin stared stolidly, evidently inventing
some answer.</p>

<p>“Me no go.”</p>

<p>“You talked there with the white man who lives
in that house?”</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head.</p>

<p>“Why did you get mad and try to strike me with
your whip when I asked you about it?”</p>

<p>“Let pore Injun go!” whined the redskin.</p>

<p>The scout repeated his question.</p>

<p>“Let pore Injun go!” was the only answer. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
redskin pretended he did not understand what Buffalo
Bill meant.</p>

<p>“You may go,” said the latter, who had no desire
to hold him.</p>

<p>The black eyes glittered. Accustomed to treachery,
the Indian could not understand this, unless it spelled
trickery of some kind.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill seized the head of the horse and drew
the body round a little, and the Indian extricated his
foot, which had not been much hurt. He limped, however,
when he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry about the mustang,” said the scout, “but
it was your own fault. You provoked it, when you
tried to ride me down and strike me with that whip.
But you may go.”</p>

<p>The redskin hesitated, looking at the pistol held by
the scout; but when Buffalo Bill repeated his permission
to go, he started off slowly, glancing back as if
he feared this were but a trick to give the scout a
chance to shoot him in the back.</p>

<p>“Here,” said the scout, “don’t you want these
things?”</p>

<p>He pointed to the rawhide accouterments on the
dead horse. The Indian looked at them doubtfully.</p>

<p>“White man no shoot?”</p>

<p>“No; come and get them.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill turned and walked away, watching the
Indian, whom he could not trust. When he had gone
some distance he saw that the redskin was stripping
the trappings from the dead mustang.</p>

<p>Having secured them, the Indian slung them across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
his shoulders and hurried away, and soon was running
for the shelter of the nearest hills. He had been badly
worsted, and he knew it; yet he could not understand
one thing&mdash;why Cody had not killed him when he
had so good a chance. Had the case been reversed,
he would have killed the scout.</p>

<p>“Now, what does this mean?” Buffalo Bill was asking
himself, as he returned to the house. “John Latimer
talked with that Indian by the gate; yet he denies
it. And when I suggested to the Indian that he had
talked with Latimer, the fact that my question showed
I had witnessed the meeting threw the redskin into a
rage and he attacked me. What is the meaning of it?”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE ATTACK OF THE MEXICAN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When he entered the big house Buffalo Bill did not
meet Latimer. It seemed useless to search for him,
to question him again, after his positive denial.
Nevertheless, the feeling had grown within the scout
that for some inexplicable reason Latimer was not
“playing fair.”</p>

<p>Not finding Latimer readily, he departed from the
house and strolled about the grounds. He had much
to turn over in his mind. He had not, for one thing,
given up solving the mysterious disappearance of Nick
Nomad.</p>

<p>As he thus strolled about, he entered the stables
where his horse was kept, and as he did so, a form
dropped on him from somewhere above, knocking
him to the earth; and then a brown hand clutched
at his throat, and a knife flashed before his eyes.</p>

<p>It took him but an instant to discover that the
would-be knife wielder was the Mexican servant; the
only servant on the place, in addition to Nomad.</p>

<p>The Mexican in making his drop had evidently intended
to land on the scout’s head, and thus strike
him down unconscious; but his heels struck the scout’s
broad shoulders; and, though Buffalo Bill went down,
he was not knocked out. He writhed about as the
Mexican tried to knife him, and then he set his firm
fingers in the brown, lean throat, making the Mexican
gasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span></p>

<p>However, the Mexican was strong, and he was
lively and lithe as a captured snake.</p>

<p>The fight that followed was of brief duration, for
the scout’s choking fingers subdued the little brown
man in short order.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill threw the Mexican against the wall.
For a time the rascal lay in a heap, limp as a rag. In
the meantime, the scout secured the long knife, which
had fallen from the lean, brown hand. He was standing
before the Mexican, when the latter tried to sit
up. The Mexican was clutching at his bruised throat
with a motion of pain.</p>

<p>“See here!” said Buffalo Bill sternly. “You would
have no right to complain if I should shoot you, for
on your part you tried to kill me.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” the fellow pleaded, his black eyes showing
fright.</p>

<p>“Will you answer my questions?”</p>

<p>The Mexican stared as if he did not understand,
until the scout repeated the inquiry.</p>

<p>“Si, señor,” he gurgled faintly.</p>

<p>“You were set on by some one to do this?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, señor.”</p>

<p>“Why did you do it? You tried to kill me!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, señor.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you attack me? Answer me
straight.”</p>

<p>“For&mdash;for dem!”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill saw that the Mexican had indicated his
handsomely mounted revolvers.</p>

<p>“For my pistols? You wanted to rob me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<p>“Si, señor,” was the bold confession.</p>

<p>“Well, you are cool about it!” He searched the
Mexican hastily and found nothing. Standing before
him he pointed the revolver and clicked the cylinder
in a suggestive way.</p>

<p>“I think you are lying. Unless you tell the truth,
I shall have to shoot you!”</p>

<p>The Mexican’s teeth chattered with fright and his
face became an ashen brown.</p>

<p>“Now,” the scout went on, “did some one tell you
to attack me here?”</p>

<p>The Mexican was so scared he could hardly speak,
but he managed to stammer out another denial.</p>

<p>“No one told you to do it?”</p>

<p>“No, señor.”</p>

<p>“You simply wanted my pistols?”</p>

<p>“Si, señor.”</p>

<p>The scout was in a measure disappointed and baffled.
He had thought that perhaps this man had been
ordered to assault him. Yet he knew that the lower-class
Mexicans are such liars that even their most solemn
statements cannot always be believed. So he
was still suspicious on that point. He threw the knife
to the crouching and whining scamp.</p>

<p>“Clear out!” he said. “And if you trouble me again
I shall certainly kill you. Clear out!”</p>

<p>The Mexican grabbed the knife and bolted through
the door.</p>

<p>When Buffalo Bill had looked at his horse and had
given him some hay, he left the stable. The Mexican
had disappeared. On approaching the house the scout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
once more encountered Pizen Kate, still hunting for
her husband. She fairly cackled with glee, when he
asked her if she had seen anything of the Mexican
servant.</p>

<p>“Say,” she said, waving her umbrella for emphasis,
“I’m believin’ that men will soon learn to fly, jedgin’
by him! He was as nigh to flyin’ as a human can git
without bein’ actually a bird with wings. He went
by here only hittin’ the high places. Well, he was
goin’ some when I seen him! What was the matter
with him?”</p>

<p>“I told him to get, and he was getting. He tried
to murder me when I went into the stables.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it?” she cried. “Well, I thought
mebby he’d seen the face of my lost husband lookin’
at him from some sing’lar place and imagined he’d
seen a ghost. He tried to kill ye?”</p>

<p>“He made a good attempt at it.”</p>

<p>Then she laughed again. “Say,” she said, bending
toward him earnestly, “between you and me and the
gatepost, there’s somethin’ so mysterious about this
here place that I think it needs investigatin’. I’ve lost
my husband here and can’t find him. So I’m goin’ to
be on guard round here to-night; and if there ain’t
happenin’s, then I’m clean out in my reckonin’, and
don’t know nothin’. Mark my words, there’ll be happenin’s
round here to-night. I kin smell trouble in the
air, yes’ as some men kin smell a thunderstorm when
it’s comin’.”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MYSTERIOUS YOUNG WOMAN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In spite of the lugubrious prediction of Pizen Kate,
Buffalo Bill retired to his own room in good season
that night.</p>

<p>Latimer had met him, after that attack of the Mexican,
and had shown great indignation when the scout
told him about it. As for the Mexican, he did not
return.</p>

<p>With no servant to wait on the table, or even to
prepare the meals, Latimer went himself into the
kitchen, and prepared something for supper. The
scout insisted on helping him in this, urging his experience
in such matters.</p>

<p>“Cody, I’m experienced, too,” said Latimer. “I’ve
told you how my servants disappear. This isn’t the
first time I’ve been left without any help. And so
I’ve been forced to do for myself, not only cooking,
but other things.”</p>

<p>“Why do you stay in such a place?” the scout could
not help asking.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you!” Latimer stood off, looking at him,
and making a striking picture as the light of the stove
fire flamed into his face. “If I should leave here, it
would be because I had been driven away by superstitious
fears. I refuse to become superstitious. I am
not a believer in ghosts.”</p>

<p>“Nor I.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span></p>

<p>“I am sure that all the things that have happened
have some easy solution. Some time ago I resolved
to penetrate to the bottom of the mystery. Should I
leave without doing that, or not be able to do that, I
should always feel that perhaps there are ghosts, and
such things. So, Cody, you see I can’t afford, for
myself, to go away. Besides,” he added, “I came out
here for my health.” He held up his arm. “Observe
that arm, firm and strong. When I came here I was a
shadow, without muscle or sound nerves. To-day I
am a well man. I regained my health here; and I do
not propose to be driven away.”</p>

<p>“As we both refuse to believe in ghosts, what is
your belief concerning these strange things?” the scout
asked. “I can’t tell you how anxious I am about
Nomad.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you have me,” Latimer admitted. “I
can’t explain it&mdash;can’t explain anything; and when I
have tried to follow out theories they were always
disproved. I am just waiting to see what will come
of it.”</p>

<p>After retiring, Buffalo Bill lay awake a long time,
thinking over the singular occurrences of the day.
His anxiety concerning the fate of Nick Nomad was
intense. Nomad had not been out of his thoughts.
It had been strange enough to discover Nomad in this
place, doing the work of a menial; still stranger to
hear that he had married, and married such a woman
as Pizen Kate; but even these things became as nothing
compared with the strangeness of Nomad’s disappearance.
More and more Buffalo Bill began to suspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
that John Latimer was not just what he seemed;
and the thought that perhaps Latimer had lured him
to this place, with evil designs against him, had strong
support in the dastardly attack made by the Mexican,
and the other attack made by the Indian.</p>

<p>The scout had been here but a few hours, yet twice
in that time had his life been attempted, he was sure.
This made him feel that a similar attempt might be
again made.</p>

<p>Thus reflecting, he placed his revolver ready to his
hand, and lay listening.</p>

<p>The time was well on toward midnight, and he had
grown sleepy, when he heard a sound at the door of
his room. The door opened, and in the bright moonlight
which flooded the room a young woman stood
revealed.</p>

<p>The scout’s start of surprise caused her to stop on
the threshold. She seemed to listen a moment; then,
as he lifted his head to get a better look, she turned
and fled. Instantly he leaped from the bed and ran
to the door; but she had vanished, and with step so
light that he could not hear her going.</p>

<p>Leaving the door open, the scout hurried into his
clothing, and then went hastily to Latimer’s room.</p>

<p>“<ins class="corr" id="tn45" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Latimer!” he called, tapipng” changed to “Latimer!” he called, tapping”.">Latimer!” he called, tapping</ins>
softly.</p>

<p>“Yes!” came the answer. Latimer’s feet were heard
as they struck the floor. A moment later the door
opened cautiously, and in the moonlight Latimer’s
gray beard appeared.</p>

<p>“Ah, Cody, you startled me! Is there anything
wrong?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me, Latimer, is there a young lady in this
house?”</p>

<p>“A young lady?” Latimer gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly not, Cody.”</p>

<p>“There is no woman in this house?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“I saw one but a minute ago. She opened the door
of my room quite as though she had made a mistake in
the room. The door was unlocked. She stopped,
when she heard me stir, and when I half rose in the
bed she fled.”</p>

<p>“Cody, you dreamed it!” Latimer insisted. “It
couldn’t have been true.”</p>

<p>“I was not dreaming. I was sleepy, I’ll admit, but
I was not asleep.”</p>

<p>“Cody, you certainly were dreaming.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill could not be convinced of this; and
he made a search through the halls, and looked into
some of the rooms. He confessed to a very queer
feeling when he returned to his room.</p>

<p>“It’s almost enough to make any one believe in
ghosts,” he commented to himself. “But that was not
a ghost, and I was not dreaming. A young woman
stood right there! She apparently came into the room
by mistake; may have tried to enter for the purpose of
assassinating me! Which was it? And wasn’t John
Latimer lying again when he said what he did about
it?”</p>

<p>Lying down fully dressed, the scout awaited something&mdash;he
did not know what. He began to feel that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
his nerves were badly upset. Presently, thinking he
heard soft footsteps somewhere, he again left the
room quietly and went in search of them.</p>

<p>He even went out of the house, and looked round
outside, carrying his revolver ready for use, for the
mystery of all these things filled him with something
as near to fear as he had ever known.</p>

<p>As he returned to the door by which he had left
the house he was startled by hearing voices; then, in
the half darkness of the shaded piazza, he saw again
the girl.</p>

<p>Here was confirmation of the fact that he had not
been asleep and dreamed that he saw this woman.
She was talking with some one; and the scout saw
at her side a young man.</p>

<p>He was about to advance and demand an explanation,
when the girl opened the door behind her, and
she and the young man vanished into the house.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill, having come out by that door, had left
it unlocked. Now, when he ran up to it, he found that
it was locked from the inside. He was left out of the
house; and to get in he was compelled to call up John
Latimer once more, doing it this time by shouting to
him below his window.</p>

<p>Latimer appeared, coming down into the lower hall
in a red dressing gown and slippers.</p>

<p>“What is it, Cody?”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill told him.</p>

<p>“Come here, Cody!” He lighted a candle and led
the way into a small side room, where, instead of answering
Buffalo Bill’s questions, he looked at him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
strangely, and then took down some small bottles from
a shelf. “I studied medicine once, Cody, and keep
medicines here for my own use. You must let me
prescribe for you.”</p>

<p>“You mean to say I did not see and hear that young
woman and young man?”</p>

<p>“I think you are not well, Cody,” was the evasive
reply. “Permit me to prescribe for you.”</p>

<p>He poured some of the contents of one of the bottles
into a glass.</p>

<p>“No!” said the scout. “I am not ill; there’s nothing
the matter with me. I need no medicine.”</p>

<p>Latimer came and looked him closely in the face,
holding up the candle.</p>

<p>“Cody, I insist that no young man or young woman
is on this place, so far as I know. But&mdash;&mdash;” He
hesitated.</p>

<p>“Finish the sentence,” the scout urged.</p>

<p>“Well, what I mean to remind you of is that there
have been strange happenings in this house. I’ve mentioned
them. These are some of the mysterious things
which I told you would make me superstitious, if
there were any superstition in my nature.”</p>

<p>“You have seen this young man and woman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have seen them. And then I promptly
dosed myself for the benefit of my nerves; not being
sure then, or now, that I had seen anything at all.
But if there are ghosts in this house&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stuff and nonsense!” said the scout. “I saw a
young man and young woman standing together on
the piazza, and heard them talking. They came into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
the house; and they locked from the inside the door
I had unlocked, so that I had to call to you to get in.
That wasn’t the work of ghosts. What became of
them?”</p>

<p>“Cody,” said Latimer impressively, “what became
of Nomad?” He looked at Buffalo Bill again in that
peculiar manner. “Cody,” he said impressively, “I’ll
tell you now something I have not hinted at. A young
woman and her lover, who at the time were occupying
the house here in my absence, were killed here.
Who committed the murder, or why, was never
shown; but I suspected the Redskin Rovers. On two
occasions since then I myself have fancied that I saw
a young man and a young woman here; but I knew
then, and know now, that it was only fancy, a result
of a heated imagination. A good many things have
happened to-day to upset you, and they have excited
your mind and made it morbid. So you fancied you
saw the young man and the young woman.”</p>

<p>To Buffalo Bill it seemed that Latimer was trying
to throw him off the scent. Yet he could hardly see
how Latimer would expect him to believe this unlikely
statement.</p>

<p>“No matter how excited I might be, is it probable,”
he asked, “that I would chance to see the young man
and the young woman that you did, when I had never
so much as heard of them or their murder, and therefore
they could not have been in my mind?”</p>

<p>“There are strange things in this world, Cody.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you.”</p>

<p>It was not the least strange to him that Latimer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
should seek to make him believe in this ghost yarn.
Again the impression was driven in on him that Latimer
was concealing a great deal and was not acting in
a manner that could be considered straightforward.
This caused the scout to feel more strongly that great
danger surrounded him, and that he must guard
against it, even though he could not foresee the direction
from which it would come.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE REDSKIN ROVERS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Unable to sleep, for thoughts of the mysteries surrounding
him, Buffalo Bill was wide awake and fully
dressed when the redskins made their attack on the
house.</p>

<p>The attack came shortly before morning, in the
darkest part of the night.</p>

<p>There came first the clattering sound of the hoofs
of mustangs. This was followed by wild and startling
Indian yells, accompanied by the discharge of firearms,
and the patter of bullets and arrows against the
walls.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill seized his revolvers and his rifle and
ran out into the hall, and with quick bounds leaped
down the broad stairway. He found John Latimer in
the room below.</p>

<p>Latimer was but half dressed, but he had a rifle,
and when Buffalo Bill caught sight of him he was
firing with it through one of the windows, having incautiously
hoisted the sash for the purpose.</p>

<p>A pattering shower of bullets swept through that
window, and it was only luck that kept Latimer from
being hit. Buffalo Bill seized him by the arm and
drew him against the wall, out of range of the shots.</p>

<p>“That is suicidal, Latimer,” he said. “Stand back
here.”</p>

<p>“It is Indians!” said Latimer, in great excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I know it.”</p>

<p>“They are attacking the house!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that, too. But you don’t want to let
yourself be killed by them. Lie down here; it’s safer.”</p>

<p>He drew Latimer down, dropping to the floor himself.</p>

<p>Some of the Indian bullets were coming through
the walls, showing that they had a few rifles of strong
power.</p>

<p>Sounds of Indians trying to break into the house at
the rear caused the scout to leave that spot a minute
later; and John Latimer leaped up and went with him.</p>

<p>The Indians had broken in the kitchen door, and
were raiding the kitchen and the food closets. Apparently,
they were bent on looting, as much as anything
else.</p>

<p>Latimer became so excited when he saw this that he
rushed out into their midst like a wild man, striking
with his clubbed rifle.</p>

<p>Before Buffalo Bill could prevent, Latimer had been
knocked down by them, and, seeing this plight, the
scout fired into the Indians he saw grouped over the
fallen man.</p>

<p>When he jumped back to avoid the return fire, they
beat a retreat from the kitchen. In going they took
Latimer.</p>

<p>The scout heard the Indians riding round the house,
yelling like fiends. Then he dimly beheld a form before
him, the form of the girl whom he had seen
previously.</p>

<p>“Come!” she cried tremulously, advancing toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
him, with hands extended. “Come!” she repeated.
“Now is the time!”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill almost forgot the howling of the Indians.
Because of the darkness he could see her form
but faintly, and her face not at all; but that she was
young was shown by the lightness of her step and by
the tones of her voice. Here was a chance to solve
the baffling mystery, so far as she was concerned. He
decided to attempt it.</p>

<p>She clutched him by the arm; and when he did not
resist she began to drag him, rather than lead him,
toward a room whose door opened not far off.</p>

<p>“Come!” she urged, in an agitated whisper, as she
crossed the threshold, clinging to him, and pulling at
him with nervous, almost frantic, haste.</p>

<p>The scout stumbled as he crossed the threshold, and
her grasp of him was broken; but he tried to follow
her as she fled on. Then he came to a sudden realization
that this was the room into which Nick Nomad
had gone and from which he had not returned.</p>

<p>This realization had no sooner come to him than
he felt the floor sink beneath him, and heard an
ominous click, which at the moment he thought the
click of a revolver. He was precipitated violently
downward, and, as he fell, he heard that click again.</p>

<p>When he struck, he landed on an earthen floor that
was dry and firm. He had not fallen far, he knew,
yet he felt dazed and dizzy; for, in addition to the
surprise of it, the fall had been heavy and had jarred
him considerably.</p>

<p>He no longer heard the yelling Indians. That the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
girl was not near him he knew. He was alone. The
feeling that he had been trapped&mdash;had been deliberately
led by this girl into a trap&mdash;was irresistible.</p>

<p>As soon as he could sufficiently get his wits together,
he felt for his metallic match safe. Always in
this water-proof safe he kept a few matches, that were
sure to be dry and reliable. One of these he struck,
and by its light he looked about, without rising.</p>

<p>Above him were the boards of a floor. About him
were the walls of a narrow tunnel. Apparently he
had been dropped through a trapdoor from the room
above into this tunnel.</p>

<p>He recalled that he had thoroughly searched that
room and even had sounded the floor, but he had not
found that trapdoor.</p>

<p>It was as plain now as anything could be that
through that trapdoor Nick Nomad had dropped, in
the same way as himself, and, of course, had landed
in this same tunnel. It seemed probable, too, that the
one who had trapped him had trapped old Nomad.
He was in a fair way of solving at least one of the
mysteries.</p>

<p>Before the light of the match went out he saw the
direction and trend of the narrow tunnel, and decided
to follow it. Manifestly, it would be impossible to
regain the room from which he had so violently tumbled.</p>

<p>Being anxious, he lost no time in carrying out this
resolve. He moved forward along the tunnel, feeling
his way with his feet and hands. He had no
desire to fall into any hole that might be there. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
intervals he lighted one of the matches, to reassure
himself.</p>

<p>The tunnel was not long, though in the cautious
manner in which he passed through it some time was
required before he reached its end.</p>

<p>When he came to the end he found the little river
before him, and about him a thick growth of bushes.</p>

<p>The river end of the tunnel opened on the side of
the high, rocky bank, and was so bushed about that
it could not be seen readily.</p>

<p>It seemed to the scout now that John Latimer must
be aware of the existence of that tunnel.</p>

<p>Latimer had built the house, and had lived in it
since its erection. Obviously, he could not have been
unaware of the tunnel and the trapdoor; yet Latimer
had not spoken of them when the scout was making
his futile search for Nomad, nor had he hinted of their
existence since. More and more it was apparent that
Latimer was not “playing fair;” but even yet there
was so much of mystery about the whole matter that
Buffalo Bill was too bewildered to reach any clear conclusion.</p>

<p>The Indians had gone, and daybreak was at hand
by the time Buffalo Bill got out of the tunnel and out
of the river gorge, and had made his way back to the
vicinity of the house and stables.</p>

<p>The house was silent and deserted; nevertheless, he
made a cautious approach, fearing treachery.</p>

<p>When sure that no foes lay in wait, he entered the
house, finding the kitchen door wide open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p>The looting Indians had gutted the kitchen, taking
everything that struck their fancy. The rest of the
house they had not disturbed, there being nothing in
it that they apparently cared for.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill visited the room through whose floor
he had made that violent plunge.</p>

<p>As when he had made his previous examinations of
it, the hidden door was so cleverly concealed that he
could not find it at first; but feeling sure now that
such a door was there, he persisted, and by and by he
discovered that by setting his foot in a certain place
and stamping in a certain way the door dropped downward,
revealing the black hole beneath.</p>

<p>He examined the door and the tunnel minutely,
being compelled to spring the door open again, as it
was weighted in such a manner that it closed instantly
after being opened.</p>

<p>As he made his critical examination, he saw that
there was a possibility that the girl had not known of
the door, or intended to trap him; she might have set
her foot on that particular spot by accident and thus
opened the door, unintentionally precipitating him thus
into the tunnel. Yet he could not make himself think
she had done it without intention.</p>

<p>When he had made a thorough search through the
big house and had found no one there, he went out to
the stables.</p>

<p>His own horse was gone, but old Nebuchadnezzar,
the horse belonging to Nomad, remained, and now
whinnied the scout a recognition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>

<p>The Indians had not deemed old Nebuchadnezzar
worth taking away. Indeed, the old horse would not
have won favorable attention from any judge of
horses. He was raw-boned, old, and seemingly had
seen his best days. Yet Buffalo Bill remembered the
good traits of Nebuchadnezzar, and looked on him
almost with affection.</p>

<p>The scout recalled now that since the evening before
he had not seen Pizen Kate.</p>

<p>Giving attention to the needs of the horse, by
watering and feeding him, Buffalo Bill left him in the
stall, and went out to look over the grounds. He
found that the unshod hoofs of the Indian ponies had
not made heavy prints in the soil, yet their marks were
plain enough.</p>

<p>“They are the Redskin Rovers,” was his conclusion.
“That is the only band operating in this section, or
near it. Whether half of them, or more, are white
men, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>He found that the Indian pony tracks came together
some distance beyond the house, and that here a tolerably
plain trail led away toward the hills. Having
worked that out, the scout returned to the stables and
brought forth Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>The old bridle and saddle, and the saddle pouches
used by Nomad, had been left undisturbed, and these
the scout put on the horse.</p>

<p>When this had been done, he tied the horse, returned
to the house, and ate some food he found there,
taking some also for the saddle pouches. After that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
he mounted Nebuchadnezzar and rode forth alone on
the trail of the Redskin Rovers.</p>

<p>Whether he could solve any of the mysteries by following
the redskins was problematical. Yet it seemed
likely that Latimer was a prisoner in their hands.
Possibly others were; perhaps even Nomad.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="fs70">SURROUNDED AND CAPTURED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The trail of the Redskin Rovers became difficult to
follow in the hills, and Buffalo Bill lost much time.</p>

<p>Night was approaching, and he had the feeling that
the Indians were far ahead of him, a feeling which
produced a lack of caution, when he suddenly found
himself surrounded.</p>

<p>The place was a little glade in the hills, with rock
walls about it. The scout had ridden into it, with head
bent down and eyes searching the trail, when Nebuchadnezzar
gave a quick jump of alarm, and with head
up and eyes rolling in alarm, tried to stampede. The
wise old brute had been taught to fear Indians, and
even the scent of Indians frightened him. Only the
fact that the wind was blowing strong from him to
them had kept the horse from smelling them before it
was too late.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill knew that Indians were near when
Nebuchadnezzar began his capering; and then he saw
them on the rocks about him.</p>

<p>The redskins were well armed with rifles and bows,
and Buffalo Bill recognized the futility of fighting
or flight. Though he might slay a few of them, there
was no doubt that they could kill him before he could
get out of the glade. Hence he elevated his hands,
palms outward, in token of friendship, while the Indians
swarmed down the rocks upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p>The old horse snorted angrily and rushed at the redskin
who first tried to get hold of the bridle.</p>

<p>“Give gun!” said one of the Indians, in a commanding
tone.</p>

<p>It was hard to do; but the scout surrendered his
weapons, retaining, however, inside his hunting shirt,
a little revolver, which he always kept there concealed.
More than once it had escaped detection, and now
again it escaped.</p>

<p>The only weapons left him were that small revolver,
a small knife hidden in one of his boots, and a fine,
thin saw embedded in the wide rim of his hat.</p>

<p>He handed over the other weapons with apparent
cheerfulness. Then he saw in the midst of the crowding
redskins the one who had attacked him the day
before, and whose mustang he had killed. This Indian
gave him a black look, and the scout knew that he
would prove an implacable and treacherous foe.</p>

<p>The presence of this Indian explained, it seemed, the
attack on Latimer’s house. It was hostility to Buffalo
Bill, fomented by the rage of this redskin, which had
brought it about. Buffalo Bill himself was the object
of the attack.</p>

<p>The excited cries of the redskins showed full well
that they understood the importance of their capture.</p>

<p>“Fortunately, the Indian whose mustang I killed
isn’t a chief,” was the scout’s reflection. “He would
have me burned at the stake!”</p>

<p>With feelings of uneasiness, he allowed himself to
be bound and led away.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar still snorted and showed his dislike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
of Indians; yet he was forced to go along, and he
received on his rough hide some heavy blows and kicks
as the reward of his protests.</p>

<p>The distance which the Indians traversed was not
great. They had a camp not far off, and to it they
conveyed the scout, who was not greatly surprised, on
arriving there, to find prisoners in the camp before
him. Latimer was there, together with Nick Nomad
and Pizen Kate.</p>

<p>Latimer maintained a gloomy silence; but Nomad
received Buffalo Bill with sundry cackles, and Pizen
Kate in a manner befitting her previous performances.</p>

<p>“That is what comes of a husband runnin’ away
from the wife of his bosom,” Pizen Kate declared,
with a snapping of her eyes. “If he had stayed to
home, dutiful and kind, as he ort, this would never ’a’
come about; but he had to leave me alone, forlorn and
forsaken, and this is the result of it. I’ve been givin’
him a piece of my mind about it, too.”</p>

<p>“Buffler,” said Nomad, “I’m glad to see ye, and
likewise I ain’t glad to see ye. Seems a singular
statement, don’t it? But I don’t need to explain.”</p>

<p>“I think I should like to have <em>you</em> do some explaining,”
said the scout.</p>

<p>“About drappin’ through thet hole in the floor?”
said Nomad. “Waal, thet war cur’us, and no mistake.
I run into the room, and the floor jes’ yawned fer me,
and I went through. I fell so durn hard, landin’ on
the sharp p’int of my spine, that I didn’t know anything
fer about a day, seemed ter me.</p>

<p>“When I come to myself better it war dark in there&mdash;darker’n<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
a stack o’ black cats. I crawled along, and
crawled along, and by and by I tumbled out of the
hole kerplunk into ther river. I come nigh about bein’
drownded then. When I went under I swallered
enough water, I reckon, ter float a boat, and I come
near going down and stayin’ thar.</p>

<p>“The river is purty swift, as mebbe ye know, and
it kerried me down considerable. When I got out, I
didn’t know where I war, fer a fac’. But I sized up
the sitervation as well as I could, and tried ter make
back tracks. Waal, I run inter the Injuns while doin’
that, and they took me in. And hyar I am, and I don’t
like ther looks of it.”</p>

<p>“If you wouldn’t talk so much, Nicholas, you’d git
fatter!” Pizen Kate snapped.</p>

<p>That irresistible chuckle of old Nomad’s sounded.</p>

<p>“Katie, I don’t want ter git any fatter. A fat man
can’t run; and I reely feel ther need of runnin’, so
long as you persist in pursuin’ after me.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all quit runnin’, seems to me, now! Seems
to me we’re in fer it. I don’t see nothin’ to laugh
about, I don’t. Yit there you set and grin like a monkey!
I keep wonderin’ what I ever married you fer,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Me too!” said Nick. “And I keep wonderin’ why,
havin’ found me out, you chase me about so. See
what’s happened to ye by doin’ thet! If you’d stayed
in Kansas City&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If <em>you</em> had stayed in Kansas City, you mean!” she
snapped. “Wasn’t you the first one to leave there?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
And ain’t it the duty of a dutiful wife to foller her
husband wherever he goes? Nicholas, if I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Too much talk!” one of the Indians grunted.</p>

<p>Pizen Kate shut up like the closing of a steel trap,
but she gave the redskin a black look.</p>

<p>The Redskin Rovers paid at first little attention to
their captives, after they had duly celebrated the capture
of the noted Long Hair. They were now busy
in getting supper, using some of the things taken from
Latimer’s. Nevertheless, the rebuke of the Indian
could not keep either Pizen Kate or Nomad quiet very
long.</p>

<p>“I told you I was goin’ to camp outside and watch
fer things, and that I knowed somethin’ was goin’
to happen last night,” said Pizen Kate, addressing
Buffalo Bill, whom she still persisted in calling Persimmon
Pete. “It happened, all right. But I guess I
wasn’t a very good watcher. Mebbe I cat-napped a
little. Anyway, I was a pris’ner of these red rascals
almost before I knowed it.”</p>

<p>She seemed to have no true perception of the very
serious position she was in, although, as if to silence
her, Nomad made wry faces while she talked, and now
and then retorted with some curt warning.</p>

<p>In the midst of the talk old Nebuchadnezzar drew
attention to himself by a shrill squeal. As he squealed
he launched out with his hind feet; and an Indian who
had been standing so near him that it drew his disapproval
received the full force of the heavy kick and
sat down on the ground with a loud grunt of pain.</p>

<p>Nomad cackled with uproarious laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span></p>

<p>“Te, he! Did ye see him, Buffler? Ole Nebby ferever!
He jes’ natcherly can’t stand an Injun! They
make him that mad thet he jes’ has to go fer ’em
when they comes nigh him. He thinks they ain’t human,
and I’m somewhat er that opinion myself.”</p>

<p>The bowled-over Indian rose in a rage and proceeded
to belabor the gnarled old beast; and as a result
received another kick that sent him sprawling
again.</p>

<p>The roars of laughter from the other Indians
showed how they appreciated the fun. Their laughter
so angered the bruised redskin that he would have shot
Nebuchadnezzar dead but for the prompt interference
of a man who had but recently come into the camp.</p>

<p>That he was a white man, and the real leader of
the Redskin Rovers, Buffalo Bill was sure as soon as
he saw him; but he was dressed as an Indian, and his
hands and face were so covered with paint that one
not closely attentive would have been sure he was an
Indian.</p>

<p>This leader caught the wrathy redskin by the throat
and thrust him back when he picked up a rifle and
would have shot the old horse, and the language he
used, though in the Indian tongue, told Buffalo Bill
even more clearly that he was a white man, for it was
imperfect, showing that he had not fully mastered it.</p>

<p>“Thet’s a white man, Buffler,” said Nomad; “and
he’s an outlaw, I reckon, and is pertendin’ thet he’s an
Injun. Them things I never could stand. Still, it
does sorter warm me up and make me feel kinder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
good toward him ter have him chip in thet way in behalf
of ole Nebby.”</p>

<p>“The question that’s troublin’ me,” said Pizen Kate,
who was apparently not interested in either the exploits
or the safety of Nebuchadnezzar, “is, now that
we’re here, how we’re goin’ to git away from here?
Aire we ever goin’ to git away?”</p>

<p>It was a question that also troubled the other prisoners.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="fs70">ESCAPE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buffalo Bill was trying to settle that question by releasing
himself from the cords with which he had
been bound.</p>

<p>This was slow and difficult work. He was bound
to a small tree, close to the camp fire, with his hands
tied behind his back, and cords were round his ankles.</p>

<p>The other prisoners were tied in much the same
manner. Nearest to him was old Nick Nomad. Close
at Nomad’s side was Latimer, with Pizen Kate farther
away, this fact seeming to give a feeling of relief to
the old trapper.</p>

<p>Nomad was also trying to wriggle out of his bonds,
and was finding it difficult.</p>

<p>“Buffler,” he whispered, “when I git a good chanct
I got somethin’ ter tell ye, about how I happened ter
be at thet house, ye know. I can’t do it now, ye see.”
He cast a sidelong glance at Latimer. “Soon’s I git
a chanct I’ll tell ye. Must ’a’ seemed ruther cur’us
ter you ter find me thar playin’ servant.”</p>

<p>“More so to find you married,” said the scout.</p>

<p>“Te, he! Waal, thet war cur’us, too. I’ll tell ye
about thet soon’s I kin. Jes’ now, Buffler, I’m tryin’
ter break the bands of ther Philistines. I war wantin’
ter tell ye, and intendin’ ter, you remember, when I
went inter thet room thar at ther house, and fell
through ther floor inter ther tunnel; and then I
couldn’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p>Buffalo Bill, after a time of strenuous exertion, felt
the cords on his wrists loosen.</p>

<p>The white man disguised as an Indian was giving
a sharp reprimand to the Indian who had wished to
shoot Nebuchadnezzar. Having done this, he approached
the old horse himself, and attempted to lay
hands on him.</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar did not have enough discernment
to discover that this was a white man, who had befriended
him, seeing only the paint and the feathers.
Indians were not to his liking. Hence, when the man
sought to put forth a hand to touch him he wheeled
with amazing quickness, launched out again with both
heels, and, striking the man squarely in the breast,
knocked him down. At the same instant, apparently
discovering for the first time that he was not tied, he
gave a shrill squeal, and dashed out of the camp.</p>

<p>The incident produced a tremendous uproar of excitement.
A number of Indians ran after the horse,
while others gathered round the fallen chief. They
picked up the groaning white man, and one, who was
apparently a medicine man, began to work over him,
for the fallen white man was half unconscious from
the effects of that terrible kick.</p>

<p>Nomad was cackling to himself, filled with delight
over the achievement of his raw-boned steed, yet having
discretion enough to keep his wicked glee from the
notice of the redskins.</p>

<p>The attention drawn to the escaping horse and to
the fallen leader furnished Buffalo Bill with a much-needed
opportunity. He cast the cords from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
wrists, and, reaching over, drew the small knife from
his boot leg and cut the cords that held Nomad.</p>

<p>“Now is your time to run for it!” he whispered, but
Nomad hesitated, surprised when his bonds fell away.</p>

<p>“But you, Buffler?”</p>

<p>“I can’t go just yet. I must look out for these
others. Perhaps I can release them, too.”</p>

<p>“Buffler, I can’t leave ye!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can release the others.”</p>

<p>But Buffalo Bill saw he could not do that. The
white leader of the Indians was being brought up to
the camp fire, that the light might be used in discovering
his condition and giving him aid.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill rolled quietly back to his position by the
little tree, thrust the knife in his boot leg, and dropped
the cords into position around his wrists.</p>

<p>“Bolt, before it is too late!” he whispered to Nomad.
“I can’t leave these others. They need me.
Perhaps you can find some way to help us, once you
are free. Go, while you can.”</p>

<p>Old Nomad hesitated no longer. Rising while the
attention of the Indians was given to the injured man,
he gave a quick leap that took him round the tree to
which he had been tied. Then, with a startling yell,
that he meant should be heard by Nebuchadnezzar, he
jumped away into the darkness, running with the
sprightliness of a much younger man.</p>

<p>The astonishing escape of old Nick Nomad turned
the attention of the Indians from their groaning
leader. Rifles were hastily seized and shots sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
hurtling after the escaping prisoner. A number of the
Indians also started in hurried pursuit.</p>

<p>Nomad yelled again, in that high key, meaning thus
to announce to Buffalo Bill that he was still unhurt,
also to call Nebuchadnezzar to him.</p>

<p>Some of the Indians came up to the remaining prisoners.
One of them was curious enough to inspect the
cords, and in so doing discovered that Buffalo Bill’s
hands were free. His cry of anger drew others.</p>

<p>The temptation was strong for the scout to dash his
fist into this redskin’s painted face, and then make a
break for safety; but, as before, he was restrained by
a feeling that he ought not to abandon the other prisoners.</p>

<p>The Indians surrounded him now, and they tied
him again, using neither kind words nor methods in
doing it.</p>

<p>However, no sooner was he alone than he was again
working to free his hands.</p>

<p>Pizen Kate was greatly excited by the escape of
Nomad. “Persimmon Pete,” she wailed, “he’s deserted
me ag’in. And now I can’t foller him.”</p>

<p>The white leader of the Redskin Rovers soon recovered
from the knock-out effects of the kick given him
by old Nebuchadnezzar, although he complained of
severe pains in his chest, and he would himself now
have shot Nebuchadnezzar, if the opportunity had
presented. For a time he remained by the camp fire,
groaning in sullen rage.</p>

<p>During that time, and while the search for Nomad
was still going on, Buffalo Bill worked quietly at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
cords on his wrists. Yet he had to work now with
extreme care, for he was almost every moment under
the eyes of some enemy.</p>

<p>By and by the disguised white man rose from his
recumbent position and came over to where the prisoners
were. He fixed his eyes on Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>“What Long Hair do here?” he said, maintaining
his character of an Indian.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill gave him a keen look, scrutinizing him
closely by the leaping light of the camp fire.</p>

<p>“Why keep up the pretense?” he said.</p>

<p>The man effected not to understand him. “What
Long Hair do here?” he repeated, spreading out his
hands to indicate that he meant to ask what Buffalo
Bill was doing in that region of the country.</p>

<p>“Talk like the white man you are, and then maybe
I’ll answer you!” was the sharp answer.</p>

<p>The man laughed, and cast aside his Indian pretensions.</p>

<p>“Your eyes are good, Cody!”</p>

<p>“I knew you were a white man as soon as I saw
you. I’m too familiar with the walk and manner of
Indians to be fooled that way. Besides, when you
were groaning there, your every action was that of a
white man.”</p>

<p>“When I get hold of that horse again I’ll beat his
brains out!” the man fumed. “He came near killing
me. He’s your brute, I think?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; he belongs to the man who escaped a
while ago.”</p>

<p>“To that old fool? <em>You</em> were riding him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<p>“I rode him because he was the only horse that your
redskins left in Latimer’s stables.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Cody, what you came there for?”</p>

<p>“I was a guest of Latimer, and your redskins captured
me.”</p>

<p>“You were merely the guest of the fellow over
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so!”</p>

<p>“What’s your opinion, then? You seem to know
more about it than I do.”</p>

<p>“I think you came here looking for me.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill laughed quietly. “The Bible says, you
know, that the wicked flee when no man pursueth.
You thought I was after you, when as a matter of fact
I had never even heard of you.”</p>

<p>“You’d heard of the Redskin Rovers?”</p>

<p>“Thanks for the information that these are the
Redskin Rovers, though I’d been guessing as much.
Yes, I’d heard of the Rovers. But I didn’t know a
white man led them, though that has been suspected.
Indians are not natural highwaymen, and when they
do turn highwaymen they are usually led by a white
man.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you know why we attacked that house?”</p>

<p>“To get me?”</p>

<p>“You guess right. We learned you were there,
from the Indian whose mustang you killed; and then
we felt that we must have you. And now that we have
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And now that you have me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p>“Well, we don’t intend that you shall get away.
As for that fool who escaped, he doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>Evidently this white man did not know old Nick
Nomad, who, as a clever fighter and dangerous combatant,
was worth any dozen ordinary men. Nomad
and Nebuchadnezzar made a combination hard to
beat.</p>

<span class="fs70">A DESPERATE VENTURE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Even while Buffalo Bill was talking with the disguised
leader of the Redskin Rovers, old Nick Nomad
was rapidly working out a plan for the release of the
prisoners. Nebuchadnezzar had escaped from the Indians,
and had carried with him his saddle and the
saddle pouches. The first thing for Nomad to do
was to get hold of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>Nomad’s wild yells as he fled, followed by his shrill
whistles, were, as Buffalo Bill knew, intended for the
ears of that wise old horse, for Nomad had trained
Nebuchadnezzar to come in answer to those signals.</p>

<p>As he ran in the direction in which “Nebby” had
disappeared, and whistled at intervals, even though the
Indians were pursuing him in the darkness, the result
was that the horse came in his direction. Hence, Nomad
had run less than half a mile from the Indian
camp when he encountered his faithful steed.</p>

<p>“Waugh!” was his whispered exclamation, expressing
the most intense satisfaction. “Talk about hosses
not havin’ sense! Nebby, you’ve got more sense than
half the humans I know.”</p>

<p>He walked straight up to the old beast; and then
mounting he rode away as quietly as he could.</p>

<p>As soon as he felt secure from the redskin pursuit
he rode in a wide circuit until he was on the opposite
side of the camp, when he again approached it. Then,
coming in sight of the fire, he halted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<p>“Nebby,” he said, as he slid out of the saddle, “I
dunno if you’ve been robbed by them red skunks er
not; but we’ll see.”</p>

<p>He opened the saddle pouches, and began to explore
them.</p>

<p>“Waugh! They tuck all the things in sight!” he
chuckled, in a way that did not show displeasure.
“But, Nebby&mdash;&mdash;” He ran his fingers into a secret
pocket in one of the pouches, and brought out a small
flat package. “They never found this hyar, and it’s
ther truck I’m wantin’.”</p>

<p>He dropped to the ground and opened the package
carefully. Meanwhile, the old horse stood with bowed
head and heaving sides. But for those heaving sides
he seemed to be asleep.</p>

<p>When the flat package lay open in Nomad’s hands,
its contents shone with a dull gleam of fire, like the
sulphur light seen when, in the dark, the head of a
match is rubbed on the damp palm of a hand.</p>

<p>“Nebby, they didn’t find this hyar truck!” Nomad
chuckled. “Do you ’member ther time, Nebby, when
we skeered them t’other Injuns outer one fit inter fifty
with truck like this hyar? It was phosphorus pizen
fer kyotes. Waal, mebbe it’s a trick thet we kin play
ag’in.”</p>

<p>Having made sure that the fiery stuff, which was a
phosphorous paste, was all there and in good condition,
old Nomad led the horse down into a low swale
between hills, that he might be out of view of the
Redskin Rovers. There, removing his shirt, he carefully
painted on his body and face certain stripes, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
imitation of the bones of a skeleton. The paste was
not enough in quantity to use all over his body, so he
left his legs minus this weird decoration; but the
upper part of his body, and particularly the ribs,
seemed to stand out in lines of fire. He also painted
his face with it, to give it as nearly as he could the
semblance of a fiery skull.</p>

<p>“Skeers yer, does it, Nebby?” he chuckled, when
the old horse showed a dislike of it and tried to back
away. “Waal, ef I kin skeer you with it, mebbe I kin
some frighten them redskins, dod-rot ’em! Somethin’s
got ter be done, Nebby.”</p>

<p>He replaced his coat, tied his shirt behind the saddle,
made a mask of his old handkerchief to hide his
face; and then, with his battered old hat pulled well
down over his eyes, he mounted, and was ready for
his desperate venture. He now rode cautiously toward
the Indian encampment, keeping as much as possible
in low ground, that a premature revelation of his
presence might not occur.</p>

<p>When he was nigh to the camp he stopped, and from
the crest of a low ridge took a look at it. He saw
Buffalo Bill sitting with back against the tree, talking
with the painted white man; and observed the positions
of the other prisoners, and of their captors.</p>

<p>Having these things well fixed in his mind, he
mounted Nebuchadnezzar again and rode slowly forward.</p>

<p>So softly did the old beast pick his way along in
obedience to his rider’s commands, that Nomad was
near the camp fire in a little while, and still remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
undiscovered. Then he stiffened in the saddle, and a
series of wild yells pierced the air.</p>

<p>It was like the sudden outburst of a chorusing band
of wolves; for the old man had the power of making
his yells peculiarly bewildering, and as if coming from
many different points of the compass. As he yelled,
he cast aside the concealing coat and pushed back the
concealing cap, thus revealing to the astonished redskins
the sight of a skeleton horseman, apparently
seated on nothing but air, for the body of the old horse
was at first indistinguishable in the darkness.</p>

<p>As he thus displayed his skeleton lines, Nomad’s revolver
began to pop; and, still yelling lustily, he rode
with indescribable recklessness straight at the camp
fire.</p>

<p>It was enough! The superstitious and frightened
Indians scudded like rats when Nomad made that
dash. They threw aside whatever at the moment they
were holding, whether weapons, food, or blankets, and
dashed in absurd panic down the hill, running like
mad.</p>

<p>The moment for action on the part of Buffalo Bill
had come.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn76" title="Transcriber’s Note—“He had not kown” changed to “He had not known”.">He had not known</ins>
what form old Nomad’s interference in his behalf would take, but he
had fully expected that Nomad would make an effort of some kind; and
for that effort he was prepared and had waited.</p>

<p>He pulled his hands free now, for the cords hung
but loosely on his wrists, and with the knife that was
in his boot leg he cut the cords that held his ankles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>

<p>The disguised white man had sprung to his feet
when Nomad made his mad charge.</p>

<p>The next motion of the scout brought out the hidden
pistol from his hunting shirt, and with it he took
a shot at the painted figure of the renegade, toppling
him over with a bullet through his shoulder. Then
Buffalo Bill leaped to the assistance of the other prisoners;
and with a speed that defied description he
cut them free.</p>

<p>“Move lively!” he whispered. “That’s Nomad.
Run, while the redskins are frightened! This way!”</p>

<p>He jumped from the vicinity of the camp fire, and
led in the flight that followed, striking straight out
into the darkness.</p>

<p>Old Nomad, shining like fire and yelling like a band
of coyotes, his revolver spouting fire and lead, and old
Nebuchadnezzar snorting like a wild horse, charged
straight across and through the camp, scattering
everything.</p>

<p>Not an Indian stayed to oppose the daring trapper;
all were in flight toward the river.</p>

<p>If the disguised white man who was their leader
suspected that this was a shrewd trick, and the character
of it, he was in no condition to make it known,
or to rally his demoralized followers; for, with that
bullet in his shoulder, he had fallen to the ground, and
lay stunned and groaning.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE FLIGHT OF THE FUGITIVES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>On the top of a low hill a skeleton form outlined in
fire shone gruesomely through the darkness. At intervals
from this specter of fire came shrill and peculiar
whistles, and high, quavering cries. Now and
then low chuckles sounded.</p>

<p>“Nebby, I hope we didn’t skeer our friends inter
fits, same’s we did them reds! Waugh! but them
Injuns was runnin’! Ef a cyclone had struck thet
camp plum’ center, it couldn’t ’a’ scattered things
wuss.”</p>

<p>He whistled again, and emitted another quavering
cry.</p>

<p>“Ef Pizen Kate ain’t fell down in a fit an’ died,
Nebby, ’twill be a wonder! Fer a lady, Pizen Kate is
ther wu’st ever.”</p>

<p>He ceased, and sat listening.</p>

<p>“I reckon, Nebby, thet when they started runnin’
they went so fast they ain’t had a chance yit ter stop.
But these calls ort ter fetch ’em. Trouble is, mebbe
they’ll also fetch Injuns. But ther skeleton looks o’
me ort ter keep ther Injuns away, I reckon. Injuns
is got more superstition than sense. Otherwise, I
reckon that yer rider, Nebby, would be layin’ dead
about now by thet camp fire. ’Twar a desprit try, but
we made it, ol’ hoss! And now if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He ceased again, for this time he had heard something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<p>“Waugh! Somebody, er somethin’, is comin’.”</p>

<p>He studied his horse’s ears, bending forward in the
saddle to do so.</p>

<p>“No, ’tain’t Injuns! Ef ’twar Injuns, Nebby’d
know it, and he’d be showin’ it. He says it’s white
men. Mebbe, likewise, a white woman.”</p>

<p>He chuckled.</p>

<p>“I hopes thet ef Pizen Kate comes in answer to
these hyar signals she’ll git so skeered of me that
henceforth and ferever she’ll treat me same’s ef I war
a gentleman, which she ain’t been doin’ lately.
Waugh! Thar they come, whoever they aire!”</p>

<p>He lifted himself in his saddle.</p>

<p>“Whoever ye aire, spit it out, er mebbe I’ll begin
ter sling bullets reckless!”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Nick!” called Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>Then Nomad yelled again with a recklessness born
of high spirits.</p>

<p>“Buffler ferever!” he cried. “You heerd me, did
ye?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t well have helped it, Nomad; you yelled
to wake the dead. If the redskins aren’t coming, too,
it will be because they are too scared.”</p>

<p>“They’re good and scared, Buffler. Who ye got
with ye?”</p>

<p>“We are all here.”</p>

<p>“Kin that be Nicholas?” came the voice of Pizen
Kate.</p>

<p>“Don’t come too nigh me, Kate, er you’ll ketch
afire.”</p>

<p>“Is that reely you, Nicholas?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p>“Waal, it ain’t nothin’ but me, with a little fire
paint added. Better be cautious about how you come
too nigh me, though; you might ketch yer dress afire.”</p>

<p>She came forward, just the same. “Nicholas,” she
declared, as she climbed with apparent painfulness to
the top of the hill, “this here is the fu’st and only time
that I’ve ever been proud o’ ye sense the day we was
married. But you aire a sight! What ye got on yer?”</p>

<p>“Waal, mebbe I’d better hide my fiery anatermy,”
he admitted. Forthwith he put on his coat; and with
his handkerchief he wiped the greasy phosphorescent
paint from his face.</p>

<p>“Where was Moses when the light went out?” he
asked, and cackled again.</p>

<p>John Latimer seemed no less surprised than Pizen
Kate. He was puffing heavily, for the sharp run had
been almost too much for him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Nomad,” he said respectfully, “you are certainly
a wonder. When I employed you to take care
of my live stock and also do other work on the place,
I didn’t dream that I had met such a genius.”</p>

<p>“I’m that smart,” said Nomad, with another cackle,
“that it plum’ hurts me at times.”</p>

<p>Pizen Kate was asking questions in a stream.</p>

<p>“Katie,” he said, “supposin’ you postpone it till
we’re outer hyar! Them redskins is goin’ ter be
huntin’ fer our ha’r in just about no time. Soon’s they
wake up ter the fact they have been bamboozled, thar
will be things doin’. Then I reckon it’ll be healthier
fer all of us ter be distant some from this place.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think their white leader will be fooled for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
long,” remarked the scout. “I dropped him, with a
bullet; but it was from this little pistol, and it isn’t
likely that his wound is very serious. If it isn’t, he
will stir up trouble for us all too soon.”</p>

<p>“Which means thet we’d better be moseyin’,” said
Nomad. “Waugh! I’m agreeable ter thet, and so’s
Nebby. Neither of us likes ther vercinity of redskins.”
He slid from the back of Nebuchadnezzar.
“Katie,” he said, “bein’ as you’re the only female
member of this hyar party, I reckon it falls ter you
ter ride the one and only hoss we’ve got. Pardon
me fer not thinkin’ of it sooner. I plum’ fergot, an’
left my comp’ny manners ter home on ther pianer.”</p>

<p>But Pizen Kate was made of stern stuff.</p>

<p>“No,” she insisted, “I don’t do no sich thing. I’m
as good a walker as any of ye, and mebbe I’m better.
You climb right back onter ther back o’ that hoss.
I’ve got ter look after yer health, Nicholas.”</p>

<p>“I reckon,” said Nomad, speaking to Buffalo Bill,
“that we might as well hike toward Mr. Latimer’s.
Er shall we strike out fer ther town?”</p>

<p>“We’ll go to Latimer’s,” said the scout, without hesitation.
There were a number of things at Latimer’s
that still needed investigation.</p>

<p>“Mebbe you want to lay around out hyar and try
ter capter ther white chief of them redskins,” said
Nomad.</p>

<p>“We’ll go to Latimer’s first. We need rest and
provisions, and also we need horses, which we’ll have
to get from Golconda. And I’m not sure but it will
be wise to summon assistance from there, also.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>An Indian yell was heard some distance away.</p>

<p>“Some Injun is lost, er has found somethin’ int’restin’,
and is callin’ ter ther rest of ’em,” said Nomad.
“Buffler, I reely think we’d better be movin’.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was of the same opinion; so they hastened
down from the hill, and then shaped their way
as well as they could in the direction of Latimer’s,
which was now a long distance off.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="fs70">STRANGE HAPPENINGS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Before they had gone far they were given evidence
that the Redskin Rovers had awakened to the fact
that they had been tricked; an awakening due doubtless
to the superior intelligence of their white leader,
who, as his talk with Buffalo Bill had showed, was not
an ignorant man.</p>

<p>Now and again a distant yell was heard&mdash;a signal
call; and signal fires flashed forth on some of the
hills. It became evident, too, that the redskins suspected
that the escaped prisoners would hurry toward
Latimer’s, because these yells and signal fires advanced
in that direction.</p>

<p>The utmost caution was required to keep now from
running into some trap. Hence, progress, though
steady, was slow, and but little talking was done.
Buffalo Bill led the way, striding on before, and Nomad
brought up the rear on Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>Nomad took care to conceal any chance sight of
the fiery lines on his body; and as for old Nebuchadnezzar,
the silent manner in which he plodded on suggested
that he understood the peril of his human companions
quite as well as they did themselves.</p>

<p>In the border of the hills, shortly before daybreak,
the little company of fugitives halted and went into
camp. But they built no fires, and they maintained a
good degree of quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>

<p>As they camped down, Buffalo Bill found opportunity
to ask old Nomad what it was he had on several
occasions tried to communicate to him.</p>

<p>Nomad cackled out his queer little laugh, and
glanced at Latimer. “Buffler,” he said, “I been achin’
ter tell ye why I went ter thet house; but now I ain’t
goin’ ter tell ye till we git ther ag’in. I’m goin’ ter
su’prise ye with it.”</p>

<p>“You can’t say, Nomad, if you know anything about
that young man and young woman I saw there?”</p>

<p>“Buffler, not a thing. I never knowed sich critters
war thar.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill again asked John Latimer what he
knew of them; and Latimer, as before, declared his
complete ignorance, although there was something in
his manner when he said it which seemed strange and
unnatural.</p>

<p>However, ever since his capture, Latimer had acted
more and more as if he were displeased with Buffalo
Bill. He had been silent and reticent, and apparently
filled with morbid gloom. And he no more talked of
the Redskin Rovers and the outlaws, which had been
his excuse for asking Buffalo Bill to come out to his
home.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that he had written many complaints
to the authorities about the raids made by outlaws
and Indians on his place, and because of these
complaints Buffalo Bill had been sent there. Now he
had dropped that subject, and Buffalo Bill began to
wonder if Latimer himself were not in some way
mixed up with the very bands of whom he had so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
lustily complained. It would not have been the first
time in his experience when such a thing had been
revealed.</p>

<p>In the camp in the border of the hills the little party
remained until after daylight, and they did not set
forth until from the highest peak the scout had taken
a survey of the country and had determined that the
pursuing Indians were not near.</p>

<p>With the coming of day, Pizen Kate became voluble
once more. She developed a surprising tendency to
ask sharp questions of John Latimer.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that you’re what you’re pertendin’ to
be,” she told him. “I think that you’re jes’ a deceiver.
All men aire deceivers, but they deceive in diff’rent
ways. Nicholas deceived me by makin’ me think that
he loved me so well he couldn’t never leave me, and
then he up and run away fust chance he got. But
you’re diff’rent from him. You’re a-deceivin’ as to
who ye aire, and as to why you’re livin’ out in this
country. Now, ain’t ye?”</p>

<p>“Woman, stop your chatter!” he cried.</p>

<p>“A woman’s tongue was made fer talkin’,” she
snapped. “I don’t shet up until I want to. And I
ain’t goin’ to want to until I know if you ain’t a deceiver.”</p>

<p>Nomad grinned while Pizen Kate was thus expressing
herself; but it was observable, at the same time,
that he paid close attention to Latimer’s comments,
and seemed disappointed when nothing came of Pizen
Kate’s tongue-wagging.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill also listened closely; for he, too, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
the feeling that John Latimer was not all he professed
to be.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of timbered land along the
base of the hills, extending well out upon the mesa
where Latimer had his home. In the open, treeless
mesa there was danger of being seen by the pursuing
redskins, and for that reason Buffalo Bill called another
halt.</p>

<p>It seemed advisable that a thorough look about the
country should be taken, and for this purpose both
Buffalo Bill and Nick Nomad separated from the
others and set forth, going in different directions.
Thus Pizen Kate and John Latimer were left behind.</p>

<p>Hardly were Nomad and Buffalo Bill out of sight
when Latimer rose from the ground where he had
been resting, and strode about, looking hither and
thither in a restless manner. Pizen Kate had her keen
and snappy eyes on him.</p>

<p>“I’ve allers heerd,” she declared, “that when men’s
consciences is hurtin’ ’em bad they git fidgety, same’s
you aire now. And I’ve allers heerd, likewise, that
confession is good fer a hurtin’ conscience. So, if
you’ve anything that’s settin’ too hard on yer mind,
why don’t ye tell me about it, and mebbe I kin help ye
some. I allers git the confidences of everybody in the
community where I’ve lived these twenty years back,
and I reckon that ought to prove that in comfortin’ I
ain’t no slow coach.”</p>

<p>It was a queer speech, and it had no effect on John
Latimer, except to irritate him.</p>

<p>“Woman, hold your tongue!” he commanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>“Well, not at <em>your</em> orderin’!” she snapped. “I’ve
been watchin’ ye, and somethin’s troublin’ you, er I
ain’t a jedge. Now, what is it?”</p>

<p>“I won’t listen to your chatter!” he asserted in
wrath, and walked away.</p>

<p>Though she soon started to follow him, for the
purpose of seeing what he did, or what befell him, he
walked so rapidly, when once he had left her, that she
lost sight of him.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t that git ye?” she mumbled, peering
through the undergrowth. “I said, and I’ll say it ag’in,
that somethin’s troublin’ that man a good deal more
than his breakfast is.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill had found some Indian signs which did
not please him, and he was hastening back to the
camp, with the intention of suggesting a forward
movement, when he came upon a sight that astonished
him. He saw Latimer walking hurriedly
through the timber growth, which here was low and
scrubby&mdash;walking as if he had an important meeting
in view and needed to hasten. Then he saw Latimer
stop before an Indian, who rose out of the bushes.</p>

<p>Latimer seemed to hold a brief conversation with
this Indian. His attitude was that of a man talking
with the Indian in a friendly manner, rather than
otherwise. But before the conversation had proceeded
far other Indians jumped out of the undergrowth, and
these made Latimer a prisoner.</p>

<p>What had before seemed so like treachery on Latimer’s
part looked altogether different now; and, seeing
that he needed aid, Buffalo Bill started hurriedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
to help him, gliding through the bushes with the silence
and ease of a serpent.</p>

<p>Then another and most peculiar thing happened:</p>

<p>A young man leaped out of the undergrowth&mdash;a
young man who swung a heavy rifle as a club. He
attacked the Indians with an awful ferocity, smashing
at them as if he cared not for his own life or the
risks he ran.</p>

<p>While he thus attacked the redskins a young woman
came running out into the little glade where these
things were taking place. There she halted, pitching
a little rifle up to her shoulder. She stood like a
picture framed by the greenery, just long enough to
enable her to draw the rifle sights down on the fighting
men; and then the little rifle cracked.</p>

<p>One of the Indians, who had been making the stiffest
fight against the young man, fell at the report
of the rifle. The second Indian the young man
knocked down. The third took to his heels, and was
followed quickly by the one whom the youth had
knocked over.</p>

<p>The young woman darted away, and came back in
a little while, leading two horses.</p>

<p>Latimer lay on the ground, apparently hurt, with
the young man bending over him. When the horses
were brought up by the girl, Latimer was lifted by
the youth to the back of one of them. Behind him the
young woman mounted, the young man leaped to the
back of the other horse, and then all rode away hurriedly,
disappearing from view almost immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<p>All this Buffalo Bill saw, as he stood halting and
hesitating.</p>

<p>It took place, too, in a time inconceivably short; so
that if the scout had even tried to reach the scene of
this swift action, he would not have arrived there before
the chief actors had departed.</p>

<p>He stood in a sort of daze, however, not starting
forward until after the horses and their riders had
disappeared; for he had recognized in that young
man and young woman the ones he had seen so mysteriously
at Latimer’s house on the mesa.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it chanced that Latimer was out
here, but the rest of it is clear enough,” was his
thought, as he walked hastily on toward the point
where this lively fight and transformation had taken
place. “Those people are Latimer’s friends, in spite
of his statements that he did not know of their existence.
Chancing to be here, they saw his strait and
rushed to his aid. That young man is a fighter of the
sort I like to see, and that girl is certainly a heroine,
as well as a cool rifle shot. I wonder who they are?
And I wonder why Latimer should have thought it
needful to deny all knowledge of them? Yes, and why
did they act so mysteriously at the house?”</p>

<p>These questions could not be answered by an inspection
of the Indian the girl had brought down; but the
scout, nevertheless, went up to the fallen redskin who
was dead.</p>

<p>An inspection of his clothing, ornaments, and weapons
convinced Buffalo Bill that he belonged to the
Redskin Rovers, which was proof enough that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Rovers were following the fugitives still, and were
near.</p>

<p>The dead Indian had a good revolver, and as the
scout needed one, he appropriated it, together with the
cartridges.</p>

<p>The trail left by the two horses Buffalo Bill followed
for some distance, until convinced that it was
headed in the direction of the house on the mesa.</p>

<span class="fs70">A DESPERATE BATTLE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Buffalo Bill returned to the camp he found
Nomad and Pizen Kate in a state of much excitement.</p>

<p>Nomad had made a discovery as important and
startling as that of the scout.</p>

<p>“Buffler,” he said, in reporting it, “ef thar ain’t high
old times round hyar purty soon, then I gives up as
a prophet. Ef them Redskin Rovers follers us down
ayar they’ll have their hands more’n full; fer thar’s a
band of outlaws hidin’ nigh, and they seem ter be
waitin’ fer them Rovers, with ther intention of doin’
’em up.”</p>

<p>“If that fight comes off, I’m goin’ to see it!” avowed
Pizen Kate. “I ain’t never seen a fust-class fight of
no kind.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve been mixed up in more’n one!” said
Nomad.</p>

<p>“Nicholas, don’t interrupt me when I’m talkin’!
That’s one o’ the things about ye I never did like; you
ain’t got any proper respect fer a lady. As I was
sayin’ ter Persimmon Pete&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ter Buffler, yer mean!”</p>

<p>“As I was sayin’ to him. I ain’t never seen any fust-class
fight. When them two prize fighters fit in the
op’ry house there in Kansas City last winter, tickets
was fifteen dollars apiece, so I couldn’t afford one, and
didn’t git to see it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span></p>

<p>“’Twouldn’t been no proper place fer ye, nohow!”
Nomad sputtered.</p>

<p>“So, as I was sayin’ ter Persimmon Pete, if this
fight comes off I want to see it. Tell him all about it,
Nicholas.”</p>

<p>“Waugh! Buffler, I war moseyin’ round, lookin’ ter
see what war ter be seen, when all to onct I heerd
some men talkin’. They war white men, and when I’d
got nigh enough ter see ’em I knowed from their gin’ral
make-up and apeerances that they war outlaws, ef
their talk hadn’t soon told me.</p>

<p>“Waal, it seems outlaws aire hyar in purty consid’able
force, hidin’, and they’re layin’ fer ther Redskin
Rovers, which aire approachin’ out of ther hills. They
sighted ther Rovers about daylight, and have been
layin’ fer ’em ever sense.</p>

<p>“It seems thet they’ve got a grudge agin’ ther redskins;
fer ther reason thet ther redskins has been
doin’ a lot o’ robbin’ and stealin’, and ther like, and
the outlaws has been gittin’ ther blame of it.</p>

<p>“They think that ther reckless doin’s of ther Injuns
is goin’ ter cause a strong force of soldiers ter be sent
out hyar. So, ter take the cuss off, they’re goin’ ter
wipe out ther reds. I cal’late they think, too, that if
one robber band is wiped out ther’ll be more pickin’
fer ther one thet’s left.”</p>

<p>“Where were these men?” Buffalo Bill asked, interested
at once.</p>

<p>“Right out yander on ther side o’ thet hill, where
ther bushes aire thick as hair on a dog and a feller
can’t see two yards afore his nose. I wouldn’t knowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
they war thar but Nebby smelt ’em out fer me; and
when I’d left ther ole hoss behind and had croped up
on foot, then I seen ’em, and I heerd ’em. Thar war
three of ’em, and it seemed they war doin’ sort of sentinel
duty.”</p>

<p>“This is important,” said the scout. “For the Redskin
Rovers are advancing, and some of their scouts
have already got this far.”</p>

<p>Then he related what he had seen, and it was of a
character to offset even the remarkable story told by
Nomad.</p>

<p>Pizen Kate again vociferously declared that if a
fight came she intended to witness it.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t fittin’ thet a lady should witness warfare
and bloodshed!” Nomad protested, with a twinkling
smile.</p>

<p>“How do you know it ain’t?” she asked. “Was
you ever a lady? And, if you never was, how kin
you speak fer ’em? I’m a lady, and I know more
what’s becomin’ ter one than you do. So, Nicholas,
jes’ shet yer baboon head and stop tryin’ ter give me
advice.”</p>

<p>“Katie,” said Nomad, with another grin, “the only
way ter give you advice and have it ter take effect
would be ter pump it inter ye with a shotgun.”</p>

<p>The fight which Nick Nomad anticipated, and which
he had heard those three outlaws talking about, came
even sooner than he expected it would.</p>

<p>The Redskin Rovers were already in the timbered
belt that fringed the lower hills. As they emerged on
the edge of the mesa they were set upon without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
warning by the outlaws, who charged, riding out of
the timber, and attacked with wild yells and a firing
of rifles.</p>

<p>The unexpectedness of the attack threw the Redskin
Rovers into confusion. But they knew who these
white men were, and that they were not only their
rivals in robbery and bloodshed, but their deadly foes
as well.</p>

<p>They rallied under the inspiriting commands of
their disguised white leader, and the fight that followed
was sanguine enough to please even Pizen Kate,
who climbed into a tree as soon as it began, and from
that coign of vantage watched it throughout.</p>

<p>Nomad and Buffalo Bill also climbed into trees and
witnessed the battle between the Redskin Rovers and
the white outlaws.</p>

<p>For a little while it seemed that the Indians would
break at once into flight, so desperate and deadly was
the outlaw charge; but when the white leader put himself
at their head and rallied them they made a stout
stand.</p>

<p>The tide of battle rolled out upon the mesa. Men
and horses dropped under rifle fire, and under arrow
and Indian lance. The combatants rode at each other,
shooting, hacking with knives, stabbing with lances,
and even seizing each other and rolling to the ground
from their saddles, to continue there to the death this
feud of hatred and revenge.</p>

<p>Now and then Nomad yelled, he was so carried
away by what he beheld; and Pizen Kate waved her
shapeless hat and uttered voiceless cheers of approval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
when something of especial and spectacular interest
was witnessed.</p>

<p>But the fight did not last long. It was too fierce.
Half the Indians, and as many of the outlaws, were
soon down.</p>

<p>The disguised leader of the Redskin Rovers fell
while trying to hold his followers together. As he
pitched stiffly out of his saddle and his mustang raced
away, his followers broke into panicky flight, having
no further stomach for such terrific fighting after the
death of their desperate leader. They rode into the
timbered hills, with the outlaws in hot pursuit; and
the tide of blood rolled away out of sight.</p>

<p>“Whoop! Whoroar!” yelled Pizen Kate, waving
her hat.</p>

<p>“Katie,” said Nomad, from his tree. “Can’t ye exercise
a leetle discretion?”</p>

<p>“Shet up, Nicholas!” she snapped. “Who aire you,
ter be givin’ sech advice&mdash;you, who ain’t done nothin’
but yell yerself out of breath ever sense ther fightin’
started! Did ye think you wasn’t doin’ any hollerin’?
If it hadn’t been that the fighters was makin’ sech a
noise themselves they couldn’t helped hearin’ ye.”</p>

<p>She slid ungracefully down from her tree, and Buffalo
Bill and Nomad came down out of theirs.</p>

<p>“We’ll be free from the pursuit of the Redskin
Rovers now,” said the scout, with grim satisfaction.
“We can thank those outlaws for that.”</p>

<p>“An’ mebbe git killed by ther outlaws!” said Nomad.
“I’d as soon die by an Injun’s arrer as by a
white man’s bullet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span></p>

<p>“Kin we go on to ther house now, do ye think?”
asked Pizen Kate. “I dunno, though, if I kin stand it
to cross that land where so many dead men aire layin’.
Seems ter me it will be sorter harrowin’ to the
feelin’s.”</p>

<p>Nomad cackled. “Katie,” he said, “you’re an
amusin’ cuss!”</p>

<span class="fs70">AT THE HOUSE ON THE MESA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Buffalo Bill and his friends went forth and
inspected the battlefield, and examined the body of
the painted leader of the Redskin Rovers, both Pizen
Kate and Nomad identified him as Persimmon Pete,
who, it seems, after leaving Kansas City, had turned
outlaw and disappeared on the border.</p>

<p>Pizen Kate seemed mystified by this identification.
Yet Buffalo Bill saw that her mystification was assumed
rather than genuine.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cody,” she said, “I axes yer pardon. But if
you’ll take a look at this man, you’ll see that when
he wore ther same kind o’ mustache and beard that
you do he looked mighty like you. That’s what made
me think you was him.”</p>

<p>“I hope that in no particular am I as he was!” said
the scout, with much earnestness.</p>

<p>“No, ye ain’t; ’cept that he was big and good-lookin’,
and so aire you. I hope it won’t make ye
blush fer a lady ter say it.”</p>

<p>“There will be at least fewer outlaws, white and
red, to trouble the border,” the scout remarked, as he
looked over the bloody field. “If they had only made
a complete thing of it, like the Kilkenny cats, and
wiped each other out, the world would be better off.”</p>

<p>“Now kin we go on to that house, Mr. Cody?”
Pizen Kate asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span></p>

<p>“Why aire ye so anxious?” said Nomad.</p>

<p>She screwed her face into a vinegary smile. “Nicholas,”
she said, “when I git ye there I’ll have ye jes’
that fur on the road home. Don’t think I ain’t goin’
to take ye back with me, fer I am; you’re goin’ with
me back to Kansas City, there to be my true and lovin’
husband, er I’ll whale the hide off ye.”</p>

<p>They helped themselves to the best of the weapons
to be found on the battlefield.</p>

<p>The way was open before them now, and they set
out across the mesa, hastening on toward the house
of John Latimer.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was as anxious as any one to reach
that house. He felt reasonably sure that Latimer
had been taken there by the young man and the young
woman, and it seemed that there some explanation
might be found of the things that had mystified him.</p>

<p>The afternoon was waning when they reached it.</p>

<p>Though the house seemed tenantless, horses were
in the stable. The scout was sure they were the horses
he had seen ridden by the mysterious young man and
young woman.</p>

<p>When he advanced with Nomad and Pizen Kate to
the house, he found the doors locked. This was but
another proof, however, that the house had been visited
during his absence, for when he had left it, shortly
after the raid of the Redskin Rovers, the doors had
stood wide open.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was on the point of forcing one of the
windows, when he heard a sound over his head, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
glancing up quickly, he beheld in the window above
him the face of the mysterious young woman.</p>

<p>The head was withdrawn instantly, and neither Nomad
nor Pizen Kate saw it.</p>

<p>“Waugh!” cried Nomad, when informed of it. “Ef
it’s ther female that trapped you, and I reckon trapped
me, look out fer more happenin’s.”</p>

<p>“Nicholas,” protested Pizen Kate, “why don’t you
say ‘lady,’ instead of ‘female?’ It’s ongallant of ye.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Pizen Kate was as anxious as any
to get into the house and discover what it meant,
when, after calling, Buffalo Bill could arouse no one.</p>

<p>The scout now forced one of the windows, and they
entered the house by that. Apparently no one was
within.</p>

<p>“She may ’a’ gone inter thet tunnel, Buffler,” suggested
Nomad.</p>

<p>But when they sprung the hidden trapdoor and explored
the tunnel beneath they found no one there.</p>

<p>“Waugh!” said Nomad. “Their hosses aire out
thar in ther stable, hobnobbin’ now with ole Nebby,
and we’ll jes’ camp down hyar until they try to git
their hosses.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and his companions took possession of
the house quite as if it were their own, and they made
so thorough an inspection of it that it seemed impossible
any one could be in it and they not aware of it.
Yet Buffalo Bill was sure that the young woman had
not left the house, unless she had done so by some
exit of which he had no knowledge.</p>

<p>With the coming of night they tried to make themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
comfortable. If Latimer was not hiding in the
house, Buffalo Bill might expect his arrival at any
time. As Latimer’s guest, he felt that he had a right
in the house. Hence, he prepared supper, using some
food overlooked by the looting redskins, and then he
and his companions sat in the darkness of one of the
front rooms, waiting for whatever might happen.</p>

<p>After an hour or two the silence was broken by
a gentle rapping on the front door.</p>

<p>When Buffalo Bill answered this without opening
the door, a man’s voice was heard, begging admission.</p>

<p>“I’ve lost my way,” said the man, “and I’d like to
stop here for the night.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill had already heard soft footsteps outside
and low whispers, and he knew the man was
lying.</p>

<p>“You are alone?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, alone, and I’ve lost my way.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing in this remote section?”</p>

<p>“Prospecting.”</p>

<p>“Well, the prospects for you getting into this house
before daylight are not good just now. Come around
in the morning, and if you are all right we’ll try to
give you your breakfast, anyway. But we can’t open
the house now.”</p>

<p>As Buffalo Bill expected, the answer to this was a
shot through the door.</p>

<p>Being prepared for it, he had stepped softly aside,
and the lead plowed harmlessly through the panel and
lodged in the wall. Following the shot there was a
rush upon the door, in an attempt to smash it from its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
hinges; but the door was a stout affair and resisted this
attempt to force it.</p>

<p>When the rush had failed, silence followed for a
short time; the outlaws were only preparing for a
more desperate attempt.</p>

<p>“I think, Buffler, thet they knows you aire in hyar,
and they’re after yer hair,” said Nomad.</p>

<p>“I think so,” the scout agreed.</p>

<p>“They knows that you’re a dangerous man ter the
likes of their kind, and they intends ter wipe yer out,
and all of us thet’s with yer.”</p>

<p>“I think you are right. But while they’re getting
ready to beat the door down, or fire the building, or
some other pleasant diversion,” said the scout, “you
might tell me, Nomad, what several times you have
said you wished to tell me.”</p>

<p>Nomad laughed in his chuckling way.</p>

<p>“Buffler, I’d ’a’ told ye long ago, but every time, as
you’ll reck’lect, John Latimer was nigh and listenin’.
Then ther thing got ter be a sorter joke wi’ me, and
I kep’ it goin’ fer ther fun of it. But when fust I
come ter this hyar house&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Even yet old Nick Nomad was not to be permitted
to tell his secret; for the outlaws made another rush
at this instant, and they jammed against the door a
heavy beam of wood, making the panels snap and
the stout hinges groan.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill fired a shot through the door, but it was
not a deterrent, and when the log of wood hit the
door again the panels splintered and the door fell.</p>

<p>In the dim light a number of men were seen, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
their faces were lighted by the flashes of the scout’s
pistols. Some of the men went down; but the others
rushed on, cursing and howling, treading on the bodies
of their fallen companions.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and his friends fell back before this
deadly rush, knowing that their position was too exposed.
The result was that the door was left undefended
and the outlaws swarmed through into the
house.</p>

<p>The scout and his companions made their way at
once toward the room which held the hidden trapdoor,
intending to defend the room as long as they could,
and then retreat by way of the tunnel to the river.
But before they gained this room the mysterious
young man appeared before them, beckoning.</p>

<p>“This way!” he called, in a shrill whisper. “Don’t
hesitate! Your lives depend on it!”</p>

<p>Yet Buffalo Bill hesitated, though the cursing outlaws
were in the hall behind him and coming on, held
only in temporary check by a healthy fear of his revolvers.</p>

<p>“Shall we resk it, Buffler?” Nomad asked.</p>

<p>A rush of outlaws toward them along the hall
caused Buffalo Bill’s hesitation to vanish. “Yes,”
he said, answering Nomad.</p>

<p>Then they followed the young man, who made a
dash toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>When they gained that, ahead of the pursuers, the
young man stopped long enough to fasten the door,
which was provided with a heavy bolt and chain.</p>

<p>“This way,” he said, again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span></p>

<p>A cupboard apparently built solidly into the wall
he now swung outward, revealing back of it a door.</p>

<p>“In here,” he said. “Quick!”</p>

<p>The outlaws were already at the closed kitchen
door and hammering on it in a way to make the bolt
and chain rattle.</p>

<p>The air of the young man was so kindly and anxious
that Buffalo Bill entered the dark opening behind
the cupboard. Nomad hesitated, then followed, with
Pizen Kate.</p>

<p>When they had passed through and seemed to be
standing in a dark, windowless room, the young man
came after them, and closed the opening by swinging
the cupboard back into position.</p>

<p>“They’ll think we went on through the kitchen,” he
whispered. “This way.”</p>

<p>He took Buffalo Bill by the hand; and together he
and the scout descended a narrow stairway, being still
followed by Nomad and Pizen Kate.</p>

<p>As they did so they heard the kitchen door give
way before the onslaught of the outlaws, and heard
the trampling of their feet on the kitchen floor, together
with their angry oaths.</p>

<p>When they had descended a short distance, the scout
judged they were in another tunnel somewhat like
the one he had been in before.</p>

<p>He found this was true; and after a short walk a
faint light appeared in the tunnel before him. Then
all emerged into an open space, and found it to be a
natural cup-shaped hollow hanging on the side of the
river ledge like the nest of a bird. Vines and bushes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
grew about, screening it from view of any one on the
opposite side of the stream; and a narrow path, bush-hidden,
led to the top of the bluff, where, through a
bushy fringe, a view could be had of the house and
grounds.</p>

<p>The light which brightened this cuplike space was
starlight, but it was bright enough to enable the scout
and his companions to make an astonishing discovery;
which was, that John Latimer and the mysterious
young woman were in this spot, and apparently awaiting
them.</p>

<p>Latimer, however, seemed to be injured, or sick;
for he was lying down, with some garment under his
head for a pillow, and he did not rise when Buffalo
Bill and the others entered.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was too grateful to ask questions.</p>

<p>The mysteries of the house, at least, were becoming
no longer mysteries. For it was plain that it had
been constructed with a view to quick and secret entrance
and exit, which, of course, necessitated the hidden
doors and secret passages. All of which might be
used in a perfectly legitimate manner, as this land of
danger made the use of such devices exceedingly wise
at times.</p>

<p>“Even if they should find that tunnel,” said the
young man, “they couldn’t easily reach us here by
coming through it; for one man at this end of it could
hold it against a hundred, if properly armed. And it
wouldn’t be easy for them to get down here by way
of the path from above, nor could they readily climb
up from below in the darkness. In the morning, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
course, it would be different; they might reach us
then, if they discovered where we were.”</p>

<p>After a time, when it became apparent that the outlaws
were looting the house, Buffalo Bill asked to
be shown how to get to the top of the bluff, and, with
some hesitation, the youth piloted him.</p>

<p>Coming out again thus upon the mesa, in the starlight,
the house and its surroundings were clearly
visible to the scout, who now advanced cautiously,
anxious to know something more about these outlaws,
to get some clearer idea, if possible, of who they
were.</p>

<p>He swerved round toward the stables, in quest of
old Nebuchadnezzar, and, as he did so, he came face
to face with a man who challenged him.</p>

<p>“I’m one of the band,” said the scout, at a venture,
dropping hand to weapon.</p>

<p>The man was not deceived. His revolver came out,
and the bullet whistled by the scout’s cheek. Almost
at the same instant Buffalo Bill returned fire, and the
man fell.</p>

<p>The shooting drew a number of men out of the
house, and the scout saw it was prudent to retreat.</p>

<p>Crawling back toward the hiding place by the river,
he bumped into Nick Nomad.</p>

<p>“I had ter foller yer, Buffler,” Nomad apologized.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before morning came the outlaws departed.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light enough to see, the scout, together
with Nomad and Pizen Kate, began to look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
over the grounds. They were soon joined by the
youth; and then the young woman appeared, accompanied
by Latimer.</p>

<p>Latimer seemed ill and suffering; but his weakness
and his lethargic manner departed together when he
came upon the body of the outlaw who had been slain
by Buffalo Bill. He stood looking into the face of the
dead man with an appearance of stupefied unbelief.
Then, with something akin to a scream, he toppled
over, insensible.</p>

<p>When the scout and the others looked into the face
of the dead man they observed how remarkable in appearance
it was to the face of John Latimer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE MYSTERY SOLVED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Their amazement was not of long duration, however,
for the young man proceeded to make explanations.
He stated that Latimer was much of the time
irresponsible mentally. His stories of the singular
disappearances of his servants were simply the fancies
of an unbalanced mind. In fact, there were periods
when he was a madman. Being a very wealthy man&mdash;a
millionaire&mdash;he had, as a crazy whim, built the big
house on the lonely mesa; and with him lived his
daughter, and the young man who was her affianced
husband.</p>

<p>Their thought was that his mental troubles would
soon pass away. Hence they humored his whims.
And when he stated that Buffalo Bill was to be his
guest, and for reasons of his own he wished the scout
to think he resided there alone, they acceded to his
wish, and kept out of sight. Yet they were, nevertheless,
seen at intervals. On the occasion when the girl
came to the scout and whispered to him to follow her,
and took his hand to lead him, she, in the darkness,
thought he was Latimer.</p>

<p>As for the hidden trapdoor and the concealed door
in the kitchen, with their connecting tunnels leading
to the river, those were planned and built by Latimer
for purposes of safety; and they had justified their
erection and planning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>

<p>“But what is the reason for his strange action on
seeing the dead outlaw?” asked Cody.</p>

<p>“He will tell you that, I think,” replied the young
man. “Come, let’s carry him back to the house.”</p>

<p>They did so, but before Latimer revived, old Nick
Nomad told his part of the story.</p>

<p>“Buffler,” said Nomad, “we didn’t intend it ter
joke ye, but it worked thet way. Yer see, me an’
Pizen thar had sot out to run thet outlaw down. Pizen
had got sight of him once, and had likewise seen Latimer
in ther town; and the amazin’ resemblance made
him think thet Latimer war ther outlaw leader.</p>

<p>“So I come on ter Latimer’s, ter play ther spy bizness,
and got a job with him as hostler. And Pizen,
he war comin’ on, intendin’ ter git a job as cook,
mebbe, er chambermaid, er suthin’. And we war pertendin’
ter be husband and wife, ye see; and him
chasin’ me about, in order ter give a proper ixcuse fer
me runnin’ frum place ter place and him follerin’ me,
er bein’ with me. I tried ter tell yer about it, Buffler,
sev’ral times.”</p>

<p>“Pizen Kate,” who was a man disguised as a
woman, had stripped away his encumbering skirt, and
now sat, grinning, while he listened to Nomad’s explanation.</p>

<p>“We thought it ruther cute,” he admitted. “And,
Cody, when we seen how fooled ye was by it, we kept
it from yer; and, o’ course, we couldn’t make no confession,
and I couldn’t change back ter my proper
person, so long as we wasn’t sure of Latimer. And
there ye aire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span></p>

<p>He was still as “homely as sin;” and now that he
had reassumed masculine clothing, he looked feminine,
for his face was womanish and naturally almost beardless.</p>

<p>“Thar war two men we war ’specially lookin’ fer,
Buffler,” said Nomad. “One war Persimmon Pete,
and t’other George Latimer, who is dead hyar, though
ther name we knowed him by war diff’rent from
thet.”</p>

<p>“George Latimer!” exclaimed Cody. “Is the dead
outlaw John Latimer’s brother?”</p>

<p>“Yep; ye kin take his own word fer it if ye don’t
believe me.”</p>

<p>It was true. As Buffalo Bill afterward learned
from Latimer himself, the two outlaw chieftains
whom he and Nomad and Pizen had come to run down&mdash;to
their death, it happened&mdash;were the white chief
of the Redskin Rovers, and Latimer’s brother, the
leader of the outlaw band of white men. The shock
of seeing his brother dead, a brother who had apparently
passed out of his memory, restored the mind of
John Latimer; so that when he recovered from it he
was again sane and mentally sound.</p>

<p>The wedding which took place in the big house on
the mesa soon after, and which united the “mysterious”
youth to the equally “mysterious” maiden, was
a great event, and was attended by Buffalo Bill, and
by Nomad and “Pizen Kate.”</p>

<p>“Katie,” said Nomad humorously, at that wedding,
cracking his face open in a grin, “this hyar makes me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
think o’ ther time when you and me was&mdash;not&mdash;married
thar in Kansas City.”</p>

<p>“Truly, Nicholas, truly!” assented the man known
as “Pizen Kate.” “And ter-night I’d be acchilly
happy, I think, if I hadn’t lost my old umbreller.”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MYSTERIOUS NUGGET.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The wedding festivities were still in progress when
Buffalo Bill received a letter, by “pony express,” from
Colonel Montrose, the commander of Fort Cimarron,
directing him to come to that station in order to reconnoiter
the district and keep an eye upon the Cheyenne
Indians who had threatened to break from their reservation.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you must go, Cody,” said Latimer, when
the message was made known to him. “I had hoped
that you might be able to linger here a while, and enjoy
a more welcome hospitality than was shown you
when you first came here.”</p>

<p>Thanking him for the offer, and reluctantly taking
leave of his friends, the great scout set forth on the
journey, mounted on his favorite horse which had
been sent to him from Eldorado.</p>

<p>And while he rode away from these nuptial celebrations,
another romance, in which he was destined
to play a part, was even now being enacted on the
wide, wide-swept plains.</p>

<p>In the doorway of a lonely sod house May Arlington,
the daughter of a government message bearer,
stood shading her eyes from the glare of the hot sun,
and looking out across the level grassland.</p>

<p>Another horseman, not Buffalo Bill, was riding
swiftly over the open country before her and coming
in her direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span></p>

<p>She knew he was not her father, who was absent far
to the southward. But she hoped he was her lover, big
bluff Ben Stevens, the handsomest and most athletic
youth in the region of the country known as No Man’s
Land, lying along the border of the upper Panhandle
of Texas.</p>

<p>“It isn’t Ben,” she said, “but one of the soldiers
from Fort Cimarron. I hope there isn’t any trouble
with the Indians.”</p>

<p>A shade of anxiety passed over her face.</p>

<p>It had been a long time since there had been any
Indian trouble in that section of the Southwest. But
people who live near Indians are never sure when the
red men will decide to take to the warpath; and lately
there had been murmurings and mutterings among
the Cheyennes, who were herded on their reservation
not more than a day’s ride away.</p>

<p>May’s father had heard of it, and had spoken of it,
but he did not believe the Cheyennes would dare make
trouble, when there were soldiers no farther than Fort
Cimarron.</p>

<p>The horseman, riding rapidly, drew near, with a
quick clatter of hoofs. He swung by the house, lifting
his cap as he did so, and then he flung out from him
something that flashed white in the sun. It fell at
her feet as he dashed on, and she saw that it was a
letter.</p>

<p>“From Ben!” she said. But when she tore the letter
open hastily she saw it was not from her lover. It
contained but a few words, which were not intelligible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
to her; and then she saw that there was something else
in the envelope&mdash;something round and hard, wrapped
in tissue paper.</p>

<p>When she pulled the tissue paper apart, there lay
sparkling in her brown palm a nugget of gold, with
strange hieroglyphic markings on it.</p>

<p>She looked at the letter again, turning it over, and
tried to find some words on the tissue paper, but there
were none. The writing&mdash;the few words&mdash;which the
letter contained, read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is a sample of the stuff I told you about;
and there’s more where it came from, if it can be
got.”</p>
</div>

<p>No name was signed.</p>

<p>She ran out from the little house, but the rider
had passed on swiftly, and now was far beyond the
reach of her voice. Although she shouted to him, and
waved her hand, holding up the letter, he did not turn
in the saddle to look back, and he did not hear her.</p>

<p>Once more she tried to find the meaning of those
words, and stared at the shining bit of gold.</p>

<p>She knew it was gold; the weight and its appearance
told her that; and the hieroglyphics on it informed her
it was not a natural gold nugget.</p>

<p>She knew that a mistake had been made, but what
it was all about she could not guess.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to thank you, young man, for this gold,
anyway,” she said, looking at the retreating horseman
with a smile. “And I’d just like to know where more
of these nuggets are!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<p>The mystery of the thing appealed to her imagination,
and set it to work.</p>

<p>There were no gold mines in that section, nor any
hint that gold was to be found. The country had long
been the stamping ground of Indians and the immense
buffalo herds which served them for game. Some
of the buffaloes were left, but most of the Indians,
after their last war with the whites, had been placed
on a reservation.</p>

<p>Since that time some cattlemen had begun to come
in, though they were few in numbers and still timid,
for there was danger that the Indians would raid the
herds, in spite of the soldiers.</p>

<p>May Arlington’s father had come to that wild land
for his health, finding the dry, pure air good for his
weak chest and threatened lung trouble, and he had
made a living, partly by keeping a few cattle, but
chiefly by some work he secured as message bearer for
the ranchmen, and for the government.</p>

<p>That was why he was away now, far to the south.
He had gone to carry a message to the Mexican
border, for one of the ranchmen, the message concerning
the sale of cattle.</p>

<p>Hence, the girl had for some time led a lonely life,
although she had not found it lonely after she made
the acquaintance of Ben Stevens, the big-hearted fellow
employed on one of the ranches. Stevens visited
her whenever he could, and he contrived to find many
opportunities. In addition, the girl had, in the little
sod stable back of the sod house, a lively horse, that
could bear her on with feet so fleet that she seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
be flying; and as she loved horseback riding she spent
many happy hours on the back of her horse.</p>

<p>Yet to most girls, or young women, the loneliness
of such a life would have been intolerable, even if their
fears, or their timidity, had permitted them to live it.</p>

<p>May Arlington went into the sod house, and placing
the round, shining gold on the small table, she sat
down and deliberately studied it, trying to make some
sense out of the strange marks on it.</p>

<p>When she could do nothing of the kind, she wrapped
it again in the tissue paper, and was about to put it
away. But just then she again heard hoofbeats; and
she ran to the door.</p>

<p>“Ben!” she exclaimed joyfully.</p>

<p>It was Ben Stevens this time.</p>

<p>He rode up at a canter, and dropped from the saddle
with the ease of a circus athlete. Then he caught
the girl in his arms.</p>

<p>“May!” he cried, and he kissed her.</p>

<p>“Ben!” she said, and nestled in his arms.</p>

<p>“You haven’t been here for two whole days,” she
added reprovingly.</p>

<p>“Right you are, sweetheart,” he acknowledged; “but
it wasn’t my fault. Work is rushing at the ranch just
now, and I couldn’t get away. No one knows I’m
here now. I was sent in this direction to hunt for
stray cattle.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got something to show you,” she cried. “And
it’s the strangest thing!”</p>

<p>He followed her into the house, permitting his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
horse to stand near the door, where at once it set
to work nibbling the grass that grew there.</p>

<p>When she showed him the gold, and the letter, and
the envelope, he was ready to acknowledge that the
manner in which the <ins class="corr" id="tn116" title="Transcriber’s Note—“gold had come to her was the strangest think” changed to “gold had come to her was the strangest thing”.">gold had come to her was the strangest thing</ins>
he had ever heard of.</p>

<p>“It’s the pure stuff, too!” he cried, as he hefted it.
“Pure gold. I wonder what those lines and marks
on it mean?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You say the fellow was a soldier from the fort?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, he wasn’t dressed in regular uniform, but he
had on a soldier’s cap.”</p>

<p>“May have been one of the scouts,” he guessed.
“And he just chucked that at you, and flew on without
a word.” He laughed again. “Gee! I wish some
fellow would chuck me a few of them! Say, that’s
worth twenty dollars, or more! Maybe a good deal
more, on account of those lines on it.”</p>

<p>He reread the singular letter.</p>

<p>“And there’s plenty more where it came from, it
says. I wish I knew where that is. I think I’ll have
to trail the fellow who flung that to you, and camp
right on his trail until I discover where this gold is.”</p>

<p>He stepped to the window at the back of the room,
where the light was strong, and held up the gold, looking
at it there, and commenting.</p>

<p>Suddenly a trampling of hoofs was heard on the
grass outside; then the door was thrown open, and
armed men rushed into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span></p>

<p>“Surrender!” they cried to him.</p>

<p>The girl screamed, but Ben Stevens turned and
coolly faced the intruders, who were soldiers in uniform.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” he said, and, though he spoke
calmly, his cheeks were flushed and his eyes were
bright. He dropped his hand carelessly toward the revolver
that swung at his hip.</p>

<p>“Hands up!”</p>

<p>Guns came down, pointing at him, and there was a
clicking of locks.</p>

<p>“Surrender!”</p>

<p>“But what’s the trouble?” he demanded. “What
am I to surrender for?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re a thief, caught with the goods on
him.”</p>

<p>The leader, who was also a young man, pointed to
the gold nugget shining in the fingers of Ben Stevens.</p>

<p>“Just how?” said Stevens, redder in the face than
before. “Is this your property?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer, “it isn’t; but it is the property
of Colonel Montrose, at Fort Cimarron; and it
was given to him only a day or so ago by Buffalo
Bill.”</p>

<p>“By Buffalo Bill?”</p>

<p>“Just so; and I suppose you know how you came
by it!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps <em>you</em> do?”</p>

<p>“You stole it from the colonel’s quarters at the fort.
We hit the trail of the horse of the fellow who took
it, and that trail, when we followed it, led right here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
and here we find you, with the stuff on you. That’s
proof enough, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” said Stevens. “For the trail you followed
from the fort went on, after leaving this house;
while, as you can see, my horse is out in front.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let me explain; let me explain!” cried the girl,
rushing forward.</p>

<p>The young troopers looked at her curiously and
with admiration. She was a beautiful girl; they had
not known so handsome a young woman was near
Fort Cimarron for some time. More than one of
them expressed his admiration for her in his looks.
But she was not thinking of this; she was solely concerned
now about the possible fate of her lover.</p>

<p>“Let me explain,” she repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss,” said the young commander respectfully;
“we shall be pleased to hear anything you have
to say.”</p>

<p>Then she told the strange story of how she had
come into possession of the nugget.</p>

<p>“I am willing to surrender it to you,” she declared.
“So you see Mr. Stevens isn’t guilty, as you thought;
and, of course, you will not try to arrest him.”</p>

<p>The young officer looked about at his men, and he
saw hesitation in their eyes. Then he remembered
that he had a duty to perform.</p>

<p>He recalled that he had trailed to this house the
pony whose tracks had guided him, and here was the
nugget which had caused the pursuit.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to take possession of the nugget,” he said,
after a moment of hesitation. “It belongs to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
colonel; and I could not acquit myself to him if I did
not take it and keep it, now that I see it.”</p>

<p>“But you believe what I say?” the girl implored.
“Indeed, Mr. Stevens knew nothing about it.”</p>

<p>The young officer bowed. “We hope we shall not
have to be disagreeable to any young lady,” was his
gallant statement. He turned to his men. “Jones and
Simpson,” he said, “go out and look for that trail
which Mr. Stevens says went straight on.”</p>

<p>The men saluted and hurried outside, but they came
in shortly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, there is a trail going on; but it seems to
us, on examination, that the horse now out in front
is really the one that made the trail we have so far
followed.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” the girl insisted, speaking to the men.
“You are mistaken. That trail, made by the horse of
the man who threw that envelope to me, leads on past
this house.”</p>

<p>The young officer touched his cap to her.</p>

<p>“I am afraid, miss, that it is our unpleasant duty to
convey both you and this young man to Fort Cimarron.
We regret this, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Arrest me, too?” she cried, her face becoming
ghastly pale.</p>

<p>“It is not an arrest in either case,” was the smooth
answer. “But we shall have to ask you and this
young gentleman to go with us, and explain this matter
to the colonel, just as you have to us. If we
should do otherwise, we would not escape severe censure.
Believe me, miss, we dislike to do this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span></p>

<p>Stevens broke in hotly.</p>

<p>“Take me, curse you!” he snarled. “But spare the
young lady, can’t you? You’re making a miserable
mistake here, as you’ll learn in a little while. I’ll go
with you to the fort and speak to your colonel; but,
for Heaven’s sake, don’t force the young lady to go.”</p>

<p>The young officer bowed again, with a touch of his
fingers to his cap.</p>

<p>“Your pardon,” he said courteously, with hesitation;
“but what you say is&mdash;er&mdash;inadvisable. We
must ask both of you to accompany us to the fort. It
is a&mdash;er&mdash;mere formality, of course. As soon as you
have told the colonel what you have told us he will
permit you to go; but we must, you understand, do
our duty as we see it.”</p>

<span class="fs70">AT THE FORT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was an unfortunate thing for May Arlington and
her lover that Colonel Montrose, the commandant,
was absent from Fort Cimarron when they were
brought to that place, and that in his stead was Lieutenant
Joel Barlow. It was even more unfortunate
for them that Barlow stood to the girl in the relation
of a discarded and chagrined lover.</p>

<p>He had but a week before visited that little sod
house out on the wide, wind-swept plains, and there
had told the girl his love, and she had turned him
away. He knew why she had done so, too; he knew
that it was because of Ben Stevens.</p>

<p>To Joel Barlow the men who had brought in the
prisoners&mdash;for they were really prisoners&mdash;made their
report; and Barlow went forth to see the girl and
Stevens.</p>

<p>He felt a secret satisfaction; for his love for the
girl, or what he had fancied was love, had turned
to hate, and for Ben Stevens he had a feeling that was
perfectly ferocious. So he smiled inwardly, and stared
at that nugget of gold, as he carefully examined it.</p>

<p>“Yes, it must be returned to the colonel,” he said,
but in his eyes there was a light of anxious questioning.</p>

<p>“Put him under guard!” he ordered, when Stevens
was brought before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span></p>

<p>“Are you going to hold me for this?” Stevens
roared in wrath.</p>

<p>“Put him under guard!” was the answer, and
Stevens, still boiling with rage, was led away.</p>

<p>The girl was then told by Barlow that she might
go where she willed, within the boundaries of the fort,
but that she could not depart until the colonel had
arrived and passed on her case.</p>

<p>As if to salve this wound, Barlow conducted her
to the rooms of Mrs. McGee, who was the “mother”
of the fort; so considered by all the young soldiers,
whom she mothered and petted when they were ill,
and at other times treated as if they were children.
Even the officers feared her when she was angry. She
was the only woman at the fort now; the other women&mdash;the
colonel’s wife and daughter&mdash;being away.</p>

<p>Mrs. McGee was red-faced and brawny; she had
arms and muscles like a man, and sometimes she
proved that she had a temper; but she had a kind
heart.</p>

<p>When she saw the suffering girl and heard her
story she was roused into indignation.</p>

<p>“There&mdash;there!” she said soothingly. “Whin the
colonel comes he’ll make it all right. And now you
wait here a bit, while I go down and give to that blackguard
Joel Barlow a bit av me mind.”</p>

<p>The “bit av her mind” which she gave to Barlow
was peppery and fierce. She wasted no words in telling
him what she thought of him for keeping the girl
there in the fort on such a charge.</p>

<p>“She’s the angel, she is, and it’s yersilf is the brute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and the blackguard!” she cried. “Was yer mother a
lady? If she was, let this girl go in reminbrance av
yer mother, and be ashamed of yersilf fer havin’
thought fer a minute av doin’ annythin’ else.”</p>

<p>Joel Barlow merely smiled. He knew Mrs. McGee.</p>

<p>“You’re too good to live, mother,” he said; “but
I’ll go over and talk with the girl. It is a shame, as
you say; but what am I to do? I’m only in the colonel’s
place here while he is away, and I have to be
mighty careful.”</p>

<p>“Ye ar-re the dirt av the wurruld!” she snorted, in
derision. “Don’t I know that the colonel wouldn’t
hold her fer wan second?”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go and see her? Of course you’ll take
good care of her, Mother McGee; but perhaps I’d better
have a talk with her.”</p>

<p>He set out to have that talk within the next half
hour.</p>

<p>Time had so sped since the “arrest” of the girl and
her lover that night was now at hand and the shadows
of darkness were gathering over the fort.</p>

<p>As Barlow passed along, heading toward the house
where Mrs. McGee lived, he came face to face with a
young trooper in a dusty uniform, who seemed to
have been watching for him to make his appearance.</p>

<p>Seeing this young fellow he turned aside, and the
two came together behind a growth of cottonwood
trees which grew beside the water pool supplied by the
deep well and windmill.</p>

<p>It must be understood that Fort Cimarron was not
just one building; rather it was a number of buildings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
officers’ quarters, and barracks for the troopers, with
stables for the horses, all surrounded by a strong,
palisaded wall. Attempts had been made to make the
place attractive. One result was the cottonwood trees,
planted where the water from the well could keep
them growing in that land of drought; and they made
a green and pleasant shade.</p>

<p>“Well, Wilkins?” said Barlow harshly, as he
stopped with the young trooper behind the cottonwoods.</p>

<p>“It was a mistake; a frightful mistake!” Wilkins
stammered. His voice trembled, and he was much
wrought up. “Yes, sir, I acknowledge it,” he added;
“it was a frightful mistake. But it was, I hope, not
irreparable.”</p>

<p>Barlow lifted his hand as if he would strike the
trooper in the face.</p>

<p>“Is it what I pay you for, to make mistakes like
that?” he demanded angrily. “Aye, it was a frightful
mistake; and I’m afraid it will have serious consequences.
In Heaven’s name, how did you do it?”</p>

<p>“Well, the two letters were left on your table, sir,
lying close together, and I was in a hurry. You had
stepped out, and I thought I hadn’t time to search for
you; and so I snatched up the two letters. I got them
mixed, and threw to the girl the one that had in it
the nugget of gold. But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Curse you for an idiot, Wilkins!” snarled Barlow.
“I ought to pistol you for that.”</p>

<p>“Of course, it wasn’t intentional, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, keep your head closed about it!” Barlow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
snapped. “Don’t say anything; not a word to anybody.”</p>

<p>He left Wilkins, and went on hurriedly and angrily.</p>

<p>He had not recovered his temper when he reached
the house where the girl had been lodged with Mrs.
McGee, this particular house being a part of the cook
room, for of the things which Mrs. McGee did one
was to supervise the cooking at the fort. She met
Barlow at the door.</p>

<p>“Can I see her?” he said. “And how is she?”</p>

<p>“A-cryin’ the two eyes out av her head. Bad cess
to ye fer that, too! If I was a man, throoper er no
throoper, I’d thrash ye fer that, so I would.”</p>

<p>“I’ll just go in and see her.”</p>

<p>He laughed, pushed past the portly form of Mrs.
McGee, and then went along the hall until he came to
a large room at its farther end.</p>

<p>The girl was in this room, and had lighted the
lamp. She stared at him with flushing face as he
came in.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I requested your presence,” she said
coldly.</p>

<p>“No, but Mrs. McGee told me you were pining for
a little comforting, and so I thought I’d call, since I
haven’t ceased to regard you in a favorable light, you
know. It was only last week, I believe, that I offered
you my hand and my heart.”</p>

<p>She turned from him and walked toward the window,
and looked out from it across the parade ground.</p>

<p>As she did this his admiration of her sprang full-armed
into being again. “Gad, what a girl!” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
thought. “Isn’t she a queen? A man could feel proud
to have her for his wife.”</p>

<p>“I have come to apologize for what has perhaps
seemed to you unnecessary harshness,” he said, in a
voice wholly changed, for now it had a sincere ring,
and his admiration looked from his eyes.</p>

<p>“It was unnecessary,” she said. “What do you intend
to do with me? I have done nothing, and Mr.
Stevens has done nothing!”</p>

<p>Barlow’s eyes hardened at that mention of Stevens.
Yet when he spoke his voice was kind.</p>

<p>“Miss Arlington, I want you to know how sorry
I am about this whole thing,” he urged. “If I were
in absolute command here I should not hold either
Stevens or you a minute. But you must see that I am
not master here. A soldier must learn to obey, before
anything else. The regulations make it impossible
for me to do anything differently until the colonel
comes.”</p>

<p>She turned again toward the window.</p>

<p>“Miss Arlington&mdash;May,” he said, his voice lowered,
“you remember what I said to you not long ago?
Well, I want to repeat it. Why can’t you give a fellow
a chance, or a bit of hope? I’m not such a bad lot,
and I’m certainly as well situated as this fellow
Stevens.”</p>

<p>She turned upon him again with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t take advantage of the fact that I must listen,”
she said. “You once claimed to be a gentleman!”</p>

<p>“And I am one now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<p>“Then don’t bring up that subject again. I never
gave you any encouragement, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“May Arlington,” he interrupted, his voice high and
sharp now, “you still stick to that, do you? And you
scorn me for that fool of a cowboy? Why, I’d have
you know that I’m a gentleman, and the son of a gentleman!”</p>

<p>She turned once more to the window and looked
out, but her cheeks were red, and one foot tapped the
carpet impatiently.</p>

<p>“And&mdash;&mdash;” he ripped out an oath, “I’ll see that Ben
Stevens has a hard row to hoe before he gets in a
position to marry you!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Just this! He was found with the nugget, stolen
from the colonel, and which the colonel valued highly
because it was given to him by Buffalo Bill, the famous
border scout. Now, you may tell me what is
generally done with a thief? You don’t need to answer.
He is sent to prison, and often for a term of
years. And that is the journey that Ben Stevens will
be taking before another month rolls by.”</p>

<p>The red went out of her cheeks and they became
ghastly white.</p>

<p>“You will try to send him to prison?”</p>

<p>“No.” He laughed. “It won’t’ be necessary for
me to trouble myself about it; the statements of the
troopers who found him with that gold will do that.
But if you had spoken to me kindly and fair I might
have interested myself in his behalf, and I might have
even got him off.” He looked at her with a strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
smile. “And to tell you the truth, May,” he added,
“I might still do that&mdash;interest myself and get him
off without much punishment&mdash;if you’d treat me differently.
Hadn’t you better think it over? You don’t
want Ben Stevens sent to the penitentiary for ten or a
dozen years, I know. And that’s just where he is
headed for now.”</p>

<p>He turned and stalked from the room, leaving her
with cheeks as white as marble.</p>

<span class="fs70">BRUTALITY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A man had passed under the window of the room
where Joel Barlow made that brutal and threatening
speech to the girl he claimed to love. That man was
the young trooper, Wilkins.</p>

<p>As he stopped a moment beneath the window he
heard something of the talk that has been recorded.
He was already angered against Barlow.</p>

<p>“Curse him!” he whispered. “Why should I stand
his insolence? Just because he knows of my love of
gambling and has kept his knowledge from the colonel,
he has gradually got me in his power, until now
I am lower than even he is, and that is as low as a
man can get.”</p>

<p>He stood listening, held by curiosity and a dislike
of Barlow.</p>

<p>When Barlow came out of the house, he walked so
rapidly that he caught sight of the stooping form of
Wilkins by the window, for Wilkins had not instantly
hurried away. Barlow drew his revolver.</p>

<p>“A sneak and an eavesdropper, eh?” he whispered,
thrown into a rage.</p>

<p>When he came nearer and saw Wilkins moving
away he recognized who the watcher by the window
was.</p>

<p>“Wilkins!” he said to himself.</p>

<p>He ran quickly forward; and when Wilkins, hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
his steps, turned about, Barlow dashed up to him
and knocked him to the ground with a single blow of
his heavy fist.</p>

<p>“Get up!” he then commanded, kicking Wilkins
with the toe of his boot. “You sneak, get up!”</p>

<p>Wilkins was weak and dazed. Barlow helped him
to his feet, and then dragged him through the half
darkness until the screening shadows of the cottonwoods
were reached.</p>

<p>“You sneak!” he said, standing Wilkins up before
him. “You low-down eavesdropper!” He lifted his
fist again.</p>

<p>“Don’t&mdash;don’t strike me!” said Wilkins, putting up
his hands to ward off the expected blow.</p>

<p>“You were under that window?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you were eavesdropping there!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A smashing blow in the face stopped the stammering
words and threw Wilkins blind and bleeding
against one of the cottonwoods. When he recovered
enough to crawl to his feet, Barlow was sitting before
him, staring at him in the half darkness.</p>

<p>“Wilkins,” he said, “that’s just to teach you that
you can’t monkey with me! When you go wrong
again I shall shoot you, which will be a great deal
worse.”</p>

<p>Wilkins cowered before him.</p>

<p>There was blood on his lip, and when he put up
his hand to his face the blood got on his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span></p>

<p>“What did you mean to do with any information
you secured in that way?” Barlow demanded.</p>

<p>“Nothing; I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And that’s another lie! But understand that you
stand by me, or I’ll see that you get what’s coming to
you.”</p>

<p>Feeling that Wilkins was duly cowed, Barlow rose
slowly and walked away.</p>

<span class="fs70">ON THE BORDERS OF DISGRACE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>He was no sooner out of sight than Wilkins sprang
to his feet, his form trembling, his eyes blazing, his
brain on fire with rage and hatred.</p>

<p>“You low-down ruffian!” he said, shaking his fist
at the retreating man. “Do you think you can treat
me that way and me not strike back at you? Well,
you can’t! Because you’re a big bruiser you treat me
that way. Well, I’ll make things warm for you in
this fort, if I hang for it.”</p>

<p>He was fairly crying, yet did not know it, and
sobs of violent rage shook him. After all, compared
with Barlow, he was a mere boy, his face still beardless.</p>

<p>“I’ll get even with you for that blow, you villain, if
it takes me a year!” said Wilkins.</p>

<p>He stooped by the side of the small canal that
brought water to the roots of the cottonwoods, and
with this water he bathed his face; yet, as he discovered
later, in removing the blood from his lip he got a
good deal of it on his handkerchief.</p>

<p>He did not leave the shelter of the cottonwoods for
half an hour, and not until he had again secured control
of his nerves.</p>

<p>There was in his heart a shaking rage against Joel
Barlow and an aching desire to “get even.”</p>

<p>As he walked along, going toward his barracks
room, he passed close by the stockade gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span></p>

<p>It was swung open, after a challenge and some questions,
and by the lamp which brightly lighted the gate
he saw Buffalo Bill ride through to the inside.</p>

<p>That the great scout had been out on the vast plains
somewhere, and was bringing in some report to the
colonel in command, was Wilkins’ conclusion when he
saw him. He stood back in the darkness and looked at
the handsome horseman who passed on from the gate
in the direction of the colonel’s quarters; then, after a
minute of hesitation, he turned in that direction and
followed.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was no more than in the room which
had been assigned him before there was a soft rap on
his door. When he opened it, he saw before him
Wilkins, pale-faced, bright-eyed, with a lip that was
fast swelling, and bruises on his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>Wilkins slid into the room, and the scout, closing
the door, eyed the young man keenly.</p>

<p>Wilkins was slender, not overmuscular, being of the
light and wiry build. Just now his dark face was
chalky in its pallor, and his dark eyes burning bright.</p>

<p>The scout, keen reader of the human mind that he
was, saw that Wilkins had come in that stealthy way
because of something he wished to say in private, and
he guessed that the young man was in trouble.</p>

<p>Wilkins dropped nervously into a chair, and pulled
nervously at the sleeve of his coat.</p>

<p>“Something I can do for you?” Buffalo Bill asked,
in a tone so kind that it touched Wilkins’ heart.</p>

<p>“I have come to make a confession!” he blurted out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span></p>

<p>“I can guess that you have been fighting,” said the
scout.</p>

<p>“No, I have not; but I was struck down, brutally
knocked down, by a man who thinks he has me for
his life slave simply because he knows certain things
against me.”</p>

<p>His face was flaming again, and his manner was
excited.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see!” said the scout, trying to help him
along.</p>

<p>“That man is Joel Barlow, now in command here
in the absence of the commandant.”</p>

<p>“Not Lieutenant Barlow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lieutenant Barlow. And I’m going to tell
you about it. I know I shall be disgraced and court-martialed,
and perhaps sent to prison; but that doesn’t
matter now. I’m going to tell it, if I’m hung for it.”</p>

<p>“I shall be pleased to hear what you have to say.”</p>

<p>Wilkins sprang to his feet, he was so excited, and
began to walk about the room.</p>

<p>“Cody, you’ve always been an honorable man, but
you know about these things! I’m a gambler; I
seem to be a slave to cards. Barlow is another, but
he’s shrewder than I am, and I think he is tricky. We
played, and I got in debt to him. I owe him five
thousand dollars. I can never pay it, of course, and
he knows I can’t; for I haven’t five thousand cents,
and he knows that, too.</p>

<p>“Well, just because I owed him so much he began
to get me to do little favors for him. At first they
were all square. Later they have begun to be crooked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
and I was too weak to refuse to do them, because of
that debt.</p>

<p>“The last has to do with you&mdash;with you, Buffalo
Bill!”</p>

<p>“With me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You know that nugget you gave to Colonel
Montrose&mdash;the nugget with the strange marks on it?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I recall that nugget. I gave it to him not
long since. And a strange nugget it is. I’ll tell you
about it some time.”</p>

<p>“Well, that nugget comes into my story&mdash;holds first
place there. For it was stolen from Colonel Montrose
by Lieutenant Barlow, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The scout came to his feet.</p>

<p>“Be sure you know just what you are talking
about!” he warned. “What you charge Barlow with
is a crime that will&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know it. It will ruin him, and I want it to ruin
him. That’s why I’m telling you about it; that it may
ruin him. I hope it will tear the stripes from his uniform
and send him to jail. And it will!”</p>

<p>He walked nervously about the room.</p>

<p>“Better sit down and tell me this quietly,” said the
scout. “I’d advise you not to shout it out of the windows.
And walls have ears, you know.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter who hears me now,” said Wilkins
excitedly. “I wish these walls had a thousand
ears, and a thousand tongues to tell the story!”</p>

<p>He strode up and down the room in a very fury of
excited anger.</p>

<p>“It ruins me, of course, but it will ruin him, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
that’s what I want. He is so high now, in the opinion
of the colonel, but this will drag him down.”</p>

<p>“Quiet yourself and tell me the story,” said Buffalo
Bill.</p>

<p>“As I said, he stole that nugget from the colonel,
and by listening under the colonel’s window he heard
its story, and knows that there are many more like it.”</p>

<p>“Ah! He knows that?”</p>

<p>“And he knows where they are; in the Moonlight
Mountains, far to the southwest, on the borders of
New Mexico.”</p>

<p>“I see that he did hear,” said the scout; “and apparently
you heard, also.”</p>

<p>“Those gold pieces are the treasure of an old Indian
medicine man, and with them he pretends to work his
charms; they are sacred to that medicine man, and to
all his tribe. That tribe is a branch of the Cheyennes
now held on the reservation near here; and if trouble
comes these Cheyennes here can be counted on to help
those in the mountains.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” Buffalo Bill admitted softly.</p>

<p>“I’m telling you this,” said Wilkins, “to show you
that I know what I am talking about.”</p>

<p>“The proof seems good,” the scout admitted, “so
far as it goes.”</p>

<p>Young Wilkins continued to walk about the room
nervously, in spite of the scout’s invitation to him to
sit down.</p>

<p>“Barlow,” he went on, “intended to get permission
to lead a small force over into the Moonlight Mountains.
There was a disturbance to be made there, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
give him an excuse, and he felt sure he could get the
colonel to send him. Well, when he got there he
meant to scheme in some way to get those Cheyennes
involved and slaughtered, and he expected to get hold
of that store of gold belonging to the old medicine
man.”</p>

<p>The scout’s interest had quickened.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you know Smallpox Dave?” said Wilkins.</p>

<p>“I have heard of him,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a borderman, a sort of renegade, I take
it. Barlow was going to have Smallpox Dave <ins class="corr" id="tn137" title="Transcriber’s Note—“slip over into the Moonlight Mountans” changed to “slip over into the Moonlight Mountains”.">slip over into the Moonlight Mountains</ins>
and there start the initial trouble which was to give him an excuse
for being sent there. So he had some talk with Dave; and then,
later, wrote him a letter. At the time he wrote that letter he wrote
another.”</p>

<p>“To Smallpox Dave?”</p>

<p>“No, to a girl named May Arlington, who lives
out on the prairie here with her father. Barlow is in
love with the girl, but he didn’t get on well with her;
and this letter had something to do with that. She
turned him down a week or so ago.”</p>

<p>“From what you have told me of him I judge she
did the right thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she did. But about these letters. I was to
be the messenger who was to carry them.”</p>

<p>“Then you were in the thing, too?” said the scout,
looking hard at him.</p>

<p>Wilkins turned toward him, trembling and white-faced.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he admitted, “I was. I had got down that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
low, by degrees. I tried to tell you about it, and how
it started in my gambling mania and the debt I owed
him. I was helping him in this thing; or, rather, was
running some errands for him in connection with it.”</p>

<p>“And if those <ins class="corr" id="tn138" title="Transcriber’s Note—“gold nuggets of the medcine” changed to “gold nuggets of the medicine”.">gold nuggets of the medicine</ins>
man were secured I suppose you were to have had some of them?”</p>

<p>“No; not so far as I know. Barlow made no promises
to me. He said he wanted me to help him; and&mdash;well,
I had so far weakened, under the threats of
disgrace he held over me, that lately I had taken to
doing anything he told me to, without stopping to ask
questions about it. And so I was to carry those letters.
They were left on a table by Barlow, who had
been called from his room in a hurry. I got them
mixed; and the letter with the nugget, intended for
Smallpox Dave, I threw out to the girl as I passed
the house where she lives. And the other letter I
carried on to Smallpox Dave&mdash;the letter which rightly
belonged to the girl.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long story, and the rest of it I’ll make short.</p>

<p>“The theft of the nugget from the colonel’s room
was discovered. In some way it was believed that a
man from outside did the work. In the search that
was made, the soldiers&mdash;pack of fools that they were!&mdash;struck
my trail, and followed it.”</p>

<p>“They weren’t so very far wrong,” remarked the
scout. “You acknowledge that the nugget was in the
letter you carried.”</p>

<p>Wilkins frowned; he did not like the interruption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span></p>

<p>“They followed me. Another horseman had come
to the house where the girl lived, and they arrested
him, thinking they had their man.”</p>

<p>“I should say they were poor trailers, if they
couldn’t tell the hoofmarks of your horse from his.
No two are ever alike, any more than two faces are
alike.”</p>

<p>“But they had the proof right on him, you see!
He had the nugget. It was in the letter I threw to
the girl as I flew by; she had shown it to him, and he
was looking at it when they came on him.</p>

<p>“And so they arrested both him and the girl, and
brought them in to the fort. He was the girl’s lover&mdash;the
one she cared for&mdash;and his name is Ben Stevens.
He’s a cowboy on one of these ranches.”</p>

<p>“And they’re here now&mdash;the young cowboy and the
girl?” the scout asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; he’s in the prison pen, and she is with Mrs.
McGee.”</p>

<p>“And Barlow is in command here now?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And, being the real thief himself, he has flung
this young cowboy into jail, and has held the girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill bored Wilkins with a keen glance.</p>

<p>“And you&mdash;why did you come to me with this?”</p>

<p>Wilkins’ violent wrath blazed out again as he answered,
“Because I want to depose him. I’ve told
you already&mdash;it’s because I want to ruin him.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>Wilkins flung himself round and faced the scout,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
and put a finger on his swollen lip, and showed his battered
face.</p>

<p>“That’s why!” he almost screamed. “He struck me&mdash;he
knocked me down; he treated me as no man
would treat a dog.”</p>

<p>“What was his reason for striking you? He must
have thought he at least had a good reason? You had
threatened to betray him?”</p>

<p>“His reason was that he caught me listening under
the window at Mrs. McGee’s to some talk he was having
with the girl; but he was mistaken in believing that
I deliberately eavesdropped. I listened, but it was
only by chance I knew he was talking there. And for
that he struck me and abused me.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you know the result of this exposure of
him?”</p>

<p>“As far as I am concerned? Yes, I know it will
disgrace me. But I don’t care now. I’ve ruined myself
with gambling. I expect to go down; and when
I go down I’m going to pull him down with me.”</p>

<p>He turned toward the door.</p>

<p>“Think what you please of me, Cody,” he said. “It
doesn’t matter now. You’re an upright man, and
can’t understand these things probably; and I’m a wild
and wrecked young fool on the borders of disgrace.
But I swore I’d do him, and I’ve done it. The rest is
for you. When you want me send for me; I’ll tell all
I know, and I’ll then take my medicine. But he goes
down with me, and that suits me.”</p>

<p>He flung himself out of the room in wild desperation,
and went clattering down the stairs.</p>

<span class="fs70">OUTSIDE THE WALLS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Lieutenant Joel Barlow had seen the entrance of
Buffalo Bill into the barricaded land about the fort,
and when the scout had gone on to his room at the
colonel’s headquarters, Barlow had beheld Wilkins
going in the same direction.</p>

<p>That view of Wilkins following on after the scout
struck sudden suspicion into the mind of Barlow. He
followed Wilkins, and saw him go toward the room
which the scout, as he knew, occupied.</p>

<p>“Something’s up,” he whispered to himself. Thereupon
he took off his shoes, and crept through the hall
up to Buffalo Bill’s door.</p>

<p>So cleverly did he perform this feat that even the
keen-eared scout was not aware that a spy stood outside
with eye to the keyhole, and hearing strained to
the utmost to get every word that was said. No very
close listening was needed, however, for in his rage
Wilkins lifted his voice.</p>

<p>Barlow’s face grew pale, and he shook with rage as
great as that of the young man who was talking to
the scout. He knew that he was being ruined by that
story, and if he could have safely reached Wilkins
with a knife he would have struck him dead.</p>

<p>When he saw that Wilkins had about finished his
revelation and would not remain much longer in the
room, Barlow retreated into the yard for safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>

<p>For a minute he stood in hesitation. The desire to
kill Wilkins burned like a flame in his heart.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it later,” he said, as he moved off; “he can’t
escape me. I’ll kill him for that just as sure as the
sun rises.”</p>

<p>He hurried to the stables. There getting his horse
he rode down to a palisaded gate. Being the officer in
command, and stating that he was going to ride round
outside for a while, he was permitted to pass out
without a word of question.</p>

<p>He rode straight out from the fort into the darkness
for a short distance, making the hoofs of his horse
clatter, for the benefit of the listening sentry by the
gate. Then he drew the horse down, and rode softly
back until he was near the corner of the wall on that
side, and tied his horse to a stunted mesquite that
grew a few hundred yards from the wall.</p>

<p>Leaving the horse, he was about to slip on to the
wall, and climb quietly back into the grounds by a way
he knew, when a dark form rose apparently out of
the ground before him. He stopped, hoping he had
not been seen.</p>

<p>“Is that you, lieutenant?”</p>

<p>The voice which called to him was familiar.</p>

<p>Barlow breathed a sigh of relief. “Yes,” he said,
and immediately the dark form came forward.</p>

<p>“I been wonderin’ how I could git inside to see ye.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak so loud, Dave,” Barlow warned, “or
you may be heard.”</p>

<p>“It was jes’ luck that I did see ye, too,” went on
the villain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span></p>

<p>“Your eyes are keen, to recognize me in the darkness
here!” Barlow observed.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, there ain’t many better; I kin see in the
dark jes’ like a cat. What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Who said anything was up?”</p>

<p>“You did; by the way you sneaked along there;
and why was you goin’ to climb over the wall here,
’stead of goin’ in through the gate? A blind man
could tell somethin’ was up by them things.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so loud!” He advanced a step and
caught Smallpox Dave by the arm. “And listen! I’m
glad you’re here, for I need you. You’re always ready
to earn money, and I’m ready to pay you more for
this job than any you ever undertook for me.”</p>

<p>“It’s about ther nugget?”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of that&mdash;here! Do you understand?
Keep your mouth shut about that. And now, listen.”</p>

<p>“I’m listenin’,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“You have a horse here, or near?”</p>

<p>“Right out yender.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. What brought you here?”</p>

<p>“Well, say, it was that letter you sent me. It mixed
me all up. What did you mean by askin’ me fer ter
marry ye, and callin’ me yer sweetheart and all them
kind of things? Say, now, wouldn’t that run any man
crazy? What did ye mean by it? Er was it some
sort of a cipher letter you thought mebbe I’d be able
to read. I tried to figger it out, thinkin’ maybe that
‘sweetheart’ meant ther nugget, and that when you
said you wanted ter marry me you was only tryin’ to
tell me you wanted ter see me bad. I didn’t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
but maybe you was afraid ther letter would be opened,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Curse the letter!” Barlow snarled. “Don’t speak
of it!”</p>

<p>“But why did ye send it?”</p>

<p>“It was a mistake&mdash;a piece of extreme carelessness
on the part of the fellow who carried it. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t stop fer nothin’; he jes’ skipped
the letter ter me as he rid along, and then on he flew,
as if ther Cheyennes was after his scalp. What’d that
mean?”</p>

<p>“That meant that he was simply in a hurry; that I
had told him to ride to another place and back, and
he had to rush to do it and get back in the time allowed.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he killed his hoss, then!”</p>

<p>“No, he came in all right, and the horse was all
right.”</p>

<p>“I don’t jes’ understand about that mistake?”</p>

<p>“That was a letter I sent to a girl, and the letter
with the nugget in it, which I meant for you to get, she
got, all through the work of that fool messenger.”</p>

<p>Smallpox Dave whistled softly. “Oh-o, I see. So
you wasn’t intendin’ to call me all them sweet names?
But about ther nugget, and the letter I didn’t git?”</p>

<p>“It was the gold nugget, and the letter appointed a
place where we could meet for a talk. But you’re here
now.”</p>

<p>“And the nugget?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all about it when I have more time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
Just now I want you to help me. Stay right here, and
soon I’ll come to you. How long will it take to get to
your horse?”</p>

<p>“’Bout three jumps and a half,” said Smallpox
Dave, with a laugh. “It’s clost ter hand.”</p>

<p>“Have your horse ready, so that you can help me
with that. And here&mdash;remember that I pay well. We
may have to get out of here to-night, if we want to
get hold of the rest of those nuggets.”</p>

<p>He slipped a coin into the rascal’s hand, and then
running to the corner of the wall, he found a place
where he could mount it, and soon was on top of the
palisades. Then he dropped, or climbed, down on the
inside, and was lost to the view of Smallpox Dave.</p>

<p>“Somethin’s up, more’n he was willin’ ter tell me!”
thought the desperado, as he felt of the coin and
dropped it into his pocket. “So he’s goin’ to make a
strike to git that Injun gold? Well, I’ll go with him
in that, you bet; but when we git the gold if I don’t cut
his throat and skip out o’ ther country with his half
as well as mine then my name ain’t Smallpox Dave.
Which it ain’t!” he added whimsically.</p>

<span class="fs70">DRIVEN BY DESPERATION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buffalo Bill did not remain long in his room after
hearing that remarkable confession from young Wilkins.
When he left it, he sought that of Corporal
Clendenning.</p>

<p>With the commandant and also the captain absent,
Joel Barlow, in his position of lieutenant, was the
ranking officer at Fort Cimarron. Buffalo Bill thought
of this as he went in search of the corporal.</p>

<p>As if to balk him, or cause him hesitation, Clendenning
was not in.</p>

<p>“Shall I look for him, or shall I take the sole responsibility
of this move?” was the scout’s question,
when he found that Clendenning was not to be found
readily.</p>

<p>While debating it, he saw in the darkness Lieutenant
Joel Barlow ride down to the palisade gate and ride
forth alone into the night.</p>

<p>This looked so suspicious that the scout lost no time
in getting his horse and following. But, quickly as he
moved, Barlow had returned to the corner of the wall
and was talking with Smallpox Dave before the scout
got outside.</p>

<p>Thus it chanced that as Buffalo Bill rode on and
away from the fort, seeking for the crafty lieutenant,
the latter, having scaled the wall and dropped down
inside, was making his way toward the abode of Mrs.
McGee, where the girl had been lodged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span></p>

<p>When he approached this section of the house,
which adjoined the big cook room, and found Mrs.
McGee’s ample form directly in front of him, for she
was sitting in the doorway and saw him before he saw
her, he was forced to play again a crafty game.</p>

<p>“A good evening to you, Mrs. McGee,” he said,
lifting his cap gallantly.</p>

<p>“Bad cess to the likes av all av ye!” said outspoken
Mrs. McGee. “The Lard niver made ye, I know, and
may the divil fly away wid his works, says I!”</p>

<p>“A kindly greeting, Mrs. McGee,” he said, trying
to laugh and to seem at ease. “Your tongue must
have been scraping over the grindstone lately, I’m
judging. What are you swearing at me about?”</p>

<p>“Swearin’ at yez, is it? Who be swearin’ at ye?”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you were.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t waste me breath swearin’ at ye.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you know that I’m in command here
during the colonel’s absence?”</p>

<p>“I know it. The orneriest birds fly highest whin
they git the chance.”</p>

<p>“Come, Mrs. McGee,” he said, hardly able to control
his irritation, “what is it you have against me?”</p>

<p>“Do ye need to ask it?”</p>

<p>“I am asking it.”</p>

<p>“It’s about the gyrul, bless her hear-rt! She do be
cryin’ her two eyes out all the time.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s just what I came down here for, Mrs.
McGee, to have a talk with her; I’ve arranged matters
so that both she and that young fellow can be
released at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span></p>

<p>“Do yez mane it?” said Mrs. McGee, rising.</p>

<p>“Nothing else.”</p>

<p>“Hiven be praised, thin! And I’m takin’ back all
the mane things I was thinkin’ about ye, and sayin’ to
yer face as well as behint yer back.”</p>

<p>“Can I go in to see her?”</p>

<p>Mrs. McGee hesitated.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell her it’s you that’s wantin’ to say her.”</p>

<p>She set out to do this, but crafty Barlow followed
her; and when she opened the girl’s door he was right
behind her, and pushed on in without asking permission
to enter.</p>

<p>Mrs. McGee retreated with as good grace as she
could, but hovered in the hall, to be near if needed.
She did not trust Lieutenant Barlow, and she was
ready to follow her suspicions with sharp words and
sharp deeds if they seemed to be needed.</p>

<p>The girl retreated across the room when she saw
who her caller was.</p>

<p>“Come, now, don’t be foolish, May!” said Barlow,
advancing upon her in the corner to which she had
fled.</p>

<p>She stared at him. She could not retreat farther.</p>

<p>“What is it you want now?” she asked doggedly.</p>

<p>“<em>You!</em>”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t understand you!”</p>

<p>“Well, during the past month or so I’ve tried to
make myself plain on that point.”</p>

<p>“And you have had my answer.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t change it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span></p>

<p>“All right, then. I’m here, as I ought to have informed
you at once, to tell you that I have found a
way by which both you and Ben Stevens may leave
this place.”</p>

<p>She took a step toward him eagerly. “Do you
mean it?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t say it, otherwise. I have talked with
the other officers here, and with Buffalo Bill, the scout,
who has just come in; and they are of the opinion
that it is wrong to hold you and Stevens. I beg you
to understand that whatever I did I did believing it
the thing I was forced to do, not the thing I wished
to do. And now if you’ll go with me I’ll see that you
are furnished a horse, and you and Stevens may both
leave here as soon as you like.”</p>

<p>She was about to follow him impulsively; but something
bade her stop. It may have been something peculiar
in his voice, hinting of treachery. Whatever it
was, it was as if a wall had been suddenly raised before
her and she was warned not to pass it.</p>

<p>“You mean it?” she said, looking at him intently.</p>

<p>“Why should I take the trouble to come here and
say it, if I didn’t mean it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know&mdash;I don’t know!”</p>

<p>He stepped to the door, expecting her to follow him,
but she did not.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming?” he asked. “What’s the trouble
now? You complained because I held you and
Stevens, after you were brought here. Now what
is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span></p>

<p>Though he tried hard, he could not keep the irritation
out of his voice.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t think I’ll go until after I’ve seen Mrs.
McGee.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. McGee is just beyond here. You can
see her as we pass out.”</p>

<p>She saw his eagerness. Why should he be eager
to have her leave that room? Again that warning,
which she felt and could not understand, came to her;
and again it was like a barrier.</p>

<p>“No,” she said; “I must see Mrs. McGee before I
go with you.”</p>

<p>He did not want her to see Mrs. McGee.</p>

<p>“Come,” he urged, “don’t be foolish!”</p>

<p>He caught her by the wrist, and his grip was so
fierce and painful that a little cry was drawn from
her. Thereupon the door flew open leading into the
hall, and Mrs. McGee bounced in. There was fire and
fury in her manner.</p>

<p>“Ye rapscallion!” she cried. “It’s me that will be
scrapin’ the two eyes out av yer head av yez don’t let
go av the young leddy.”</p>

<p>Barlow was thrown into a rage. Time was precious
to him, and he knew the loud voice of Mrs McGee
would bring some one hurrying to the spot.</p>

<p>“Stand back!” he said. “I’m the commander here,
Mrs. McGee, and I won’t stand any of your nonsense.”</p>

<p>But her rush was so fierce that he released the arm
of the girl to defend himself.</p>

<p>“No matter phat yez are, ye’re no gintleman!” Mrs.
McGee told him, as she scratched and struck at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
face. “Run!” she panted to the girl. “Git outside and
yell fer help, while I fight this divil here. I knew he
was plannin’ the black deed. Run fur yer life!”</p>

<p>The girl started to run.</p>

<p>Barlow caught the old woman by the throat now
and jammed her heavily against the wall; and, when
she still fought and scratched at him, he dealt her a
smashing blow between the eyes that dropped her like
an ox in the shambles.</p>

<p>As she fell he sprang over her and dashed after
May Arlington, who was running through the corridor,
gasping in an attempt to make an outcry that
would bring help. He overtook her with quick leaps
before she gained the outside door, and again his hand
fell on her arm.</p>

<p>“Come!” he said, “this is foolish. That old idiot
butted in where she had no business. I don’t intend to
harm you, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>May Arlington turned on him, wild and desperate;
though she really did not know what she feared.</p>

<p>“Let me go!” she begged.</p>

<p>“Come with me quietly then. I mean no harm.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“You won’t go with me?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He thought he heard footsteps outside, and he knew
that Mrs. McGee would soon be on her feet and yelling
behind him. He could not parley, nor delay.</p>

<p>“I see I’ve got to save you, in spite of yourself,”
he said. “You don’t understand the situation, and I
haven’t wanted to scare you by telling you of it. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
the Cheyennes are on the warpath and will attack the
fort in less than an hour. What I want to do is to
get you outside and to safety while I can.”</p>

<p>She stopped her desperate resistance.</p>

<p>“The Cheyennes?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ve got to get out of here quick.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Stevens?” she asked.</p>

<p>“He is to be released and will join you!”</p>

<p>“You’re not lying to me?”</p>

<p>“Why should I? Come quick.”</p>

<p>She was almost convinced. “No!” she said, again
feeling that warning, and also because it did not seem
right for her to leave Mrs. McGee.</p>

<p>“You won’t let me help you, to save you from the
Cheyennes?”</p>

<p>“No. Please release my wrist. I’m going back to
see what you have done to Mrs. McGee.”</p>

<p>A bitter curse broke from his lips.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll save you in spite of yourself.”</p>

<p>He caught out from his pocket what seemed a very
large handkerchief. Before she divined his intent he
threw it over her head; and then clutching her by the
throat, he stifled her cries.</p>

<p>The assault was so sudden and dastardly, and withal
it so frightened her, that she slid to the floor in a
faint.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven for that!” he panted.</p>

<p>Then he caught her in his arms, drew open the door
before him, and, carrying her thus, he stepped out into
the darkness of the yard.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MAN IN THE SHADOWS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Buffalo Bill returned to the palisade gate,
having seen nothing of Lieutenant Barlow, the man
he had followed out on the prairie, he was careful to
ask the sentry if Barlow had returned.</p>

<p>Being told that Barlow was still outside&mdash;a thing
which the sentry believed to be true&mdash;the scout rode
slowly away from the gate, intending to look farther.</p>

<p>Riding thus along he saw near the corner of the
palisade wall the slinking form of Smallpox Dave.</p>

<p>He did not know who the man was, and could not
see him clearly, but the renegade’s creeping manner
spoke of treacherous conduct of some kind.</p>

<p>Thereupon Buffalo Bill softly dismounted, and,
leaving his horse standing, he crept toward that corner
of the wall, intending to discover just what this
man was doing.</p>

<p>Smallpox Dave had secreted himself in the shadows
by the wall. His horse and that of Lieutenant Barlow
were well concealed not far off, and he was awaiting
Barlow’s reappearance and further orders. He did
not know that the scout was drawing close upon him,
for the advance of Buffalo Bill was made as quietly as
that of a panther.</p>

<p>When still some yards from the hiding spot of
Smallpox Dave, Buffalo Bill dropped to the ground,
intending to await the movement of the man hidden
by the wall, whom he was now unable to see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span></p>

<p>He had scarcely done so when he heard hurried feet
within the ground of the fort, and then a whispering
voice:</p>

<p>“All ready over there?”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill lifted himself on hands and knees and
felt for his revolver. He knew the words were not
meant for him. Nevertheless, he would be ready for
whatever happened.</p>

<p>The man in the shadow whispered something.</p>

<p>The feet were heard again on the other side of the
wall, and this was followed by a scraping sound.
Then the form of Lieutenant Barlow appeared on top
of the wall with the unconscious girl in his arms.</p>

<p>“Hoist that block,” Barlow commanded.</p>

<p>Smallpox Dave came out of his <ins class="corr" id="tn154" title="Transcriber’s Note—“concealment and up-ended against the fall” changed to “concealment and up-ended against the wall”.">concealment and up-ended against the wall</ins>
a length of timber, slanting it against the wall. To the top of
this he scrambled, and reached up his arms to help Barlow with his
burden.</p>

<p>“Be careful there,” Barlow cautioned.</p>

<p>“What ye got?” was the question.</p>

<p>“A girl&mdash;a woman. She’s fainted. Steady there!”</p>

<p>He clambered over the top of the wall, and with
Barlow’s help began to slide down to the ground.</p>

<p>At this juncture May Arlington came suddenly out
of her swoon. The descending motion made her think
she was falling, and she screamed.</p>

<p>Apparently the time for action on the scout’s part
had come. Buffalo Bill sprang forward, a revolver
swinging in his right hand.</p>

<p>“Halt there!” he commanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span></p>

<p>The girl screamed, and a curse of rage broke from
Barlow.</p>

<p>“Halt!” said the scout. “Surrender that girl, whoever
she is, and whoever you are.”</p>

<p>Smallpox Dave was unfortunately so frightened by
this that he gave a wild jump backward, away from
the wall; and in this jump one of his flying feet struck
the end of the scout’s extended revolver.</p>

<p>A loud report sounded, as the revolver was discharged
harmlessly into the air.</p>

<p>The girl and Barlow dropped together to the
ground, seeming to fall in a heap.</p>

<p>Smallpox Dave, being down, and hardly knowing
what he did, caught Buffalo Bill by the ankle, as the
scout tried to leap to the aid of the girl. The result
was that the scout came down heavily across the body
of Smallpox Dave, who wound his arms around Buffalo
Bill, and tried to hold him.</p>

<p>The scout smashed his fist into the face of the renegade
and tried to wrench loose.</p>

<p>Valuable time was thus lost, and this valuable time
Barlow made the most of, by catching the girl up in
his arms and running with her straight out from the
wall into the darkness.</p>

<p>When Buffalo Bill succeeded in breaking the hold of
Smallpox Dave, he leaped to his feet, with the intention
of rushing in pursuit of Barlow, but again he was
balked by the renegade, who caught him once more by
the ankles and tripped him so that he fell sprawling.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he sprang up and went in pursuit of
the vanishing forms as quickly as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span></p>

<p>But the time lost had been all in favor of Lieutenant
Barlow. The darkness was a friendly aid. Buffalo
Bill could not now see him, nor, when he stopped to
harken, could the scout hear him.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill dropped flat to the ground, and listened
with ear pressed to the earth. The only sounds
reaching him were from the direction of the palisade
wall. Footsteps were approaching from that direction,
which led the scout to think that the man who
had so troubled and foiled him there was advancing.</p>

<p>“Gone into hiding,” was his conclusion concerning
the man with the girl; “and if he is clever at it, in this
darkness he will make trouble.”</p>

<p>For some time he lay flat on his face listening.
Finally he rose to a half-sitting position, for the man
advancing stealthily from the direction of the wall was
now quite near.</p>

<p>This man was Smallpox Dave. The villain had his
knife out, and was warily picking his way along, not
knowing what foe he might meet, and trying to be
prepared for any encounter. He was aware that the
man whom he had tackled was none other than the
noted scout, Buffalo Bill. His face was bleeding, his
throat ached from the clutching grip of the scout’s
iron fingers, and his head roared in a dizzy way.</p>

<p>He was proceeding in the direction in which he had
left his own horse and that of Barlow, and he was
hoping there to meet Barlow and learn from him what
was now to be done. At the same time he was watching,
not wishing to run afoul of Buffalo Bill. Yet
that was the very thing he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>

<p>A hand reached forward and upward out of the
darkness, his leg was caught, he was thrown with
blinding and stunning quickness, and then the redoubtable
scout was on top of him, holding a knife at his
throat.</p>

<p>“Make a sound and you die!” was whispered in
his ear, while the blade of the knife was pressed down
against his throat in a way to make him lay as quiet
as if dead.</p>

<p>“Let up!” he begged, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>A cord was thrown round one wrist, and leg irons
were snapped on his ankles, and they held him now
helpless.</p>

<p>“Hold out your hands,” was the low command.</p>

<p>“See here, I don’t know ye, but I ain’t done nothin’!”
Smallpox Dave whined, thoroughly alarmed
now.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill tied him. “You’re the man I had a
fight with by the wall a few minutes ago,” he said.
“Tell me who the other man was who came over the
wall, and who the girl was?”</p>

<p>“I dunno what you’re talkin’ about!” Smallpox
Dave whined.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do; and you’ll out with it, or I’ll use
this knife on you! I’m looking for that other man,
and if you talk quick and talk straight it will be all
the better for you. I want to know who that man was,
and what has become of him?”</p>

<p>“Boss, I’d tell you if I knowed; I don’t know!”</p>

<p>Bound though Smallpox Dave was, the scout
gripped him again by the throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span></p>

<p>“You scoundrel, speak out the truth, and speak it
quick!” he cried.</p>

<p>Smallpox Dave gasped and gurgled. “Don’t&mdash;don’t!”
he begged. “I’ll tell what I know.”</p>

<p>The fingers of the scout relaxed.</p>

<p>“Speak quick,” he commanded. “Who was that
man?”</p>

<p>Smallpox Dave shivered&mdash;he did not want to tell,
but again the scout set his fingers to the throat of the
miscreant.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll tell,” the strangling and frightened wretch
now wheezed.</p>

<p>“Who was that man?” Buffalo Bill demanded.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Barlow.”</p>

<p>“And the girl?”</p>

<p>“The one that lived in the sod house out on the
prairie&mdash;Arlington’s girl.”</p>

<p>The scout released him.</p>

<p>“Lie there, and if you make any sound, when I come
back it will be the worse for you.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill leaped away, going once more in the
direction which Barlow seemed to have taken the girl.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="fs70">A VILLAIN IN FLIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Lieutenant Joel Barlow was clever in his flight.</p>

<p>He knew that it was Buffalo Bill who had appeared
at the corner of the wall, and with whom he had left
Smallpox Dave fighting. And he feared the scout
above all other men, for Buffalo Bill was noted as a
hater of wrongs of all kinds, and as a relentless punisher
of wrongdoers.</p>

<p>Barlow’s first intention was to gain the point where
the horses had been secreted by Smallpox Dave, and
with these horses make a wild flight. But he was so
quickly pursued by the scout that, instead of making
that attempt at once, he simply dropped down in the
darkness, in a low, grassy swale, and lay there, without
motion or word.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, the girl had again fainted, and
when he dropped her to the ground she lay there as
one dead. Thus it had come about that when the
scout, by pressing his ear to the earth, sought for
some sound of the fleeing man no sound reached him.</p>

<p>Not until Buffalo Bill had engaged again with
Smallpox Dave and a hot struggle was for a few moments
in progress did Barlow dare to climb to his feet,
when he lifted the girl in his arms, and continued his
flight.</p>

<p>Thus while the scout was threatening Smallpox
Dave and getting from him Barlow’s name and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
name of the girl, the desperate lieutenant gained the
screen of bushes where the horses were; and he took
with him the scout’s own horse, which he encountered
and captured.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Smallpox Dave,” he whispered; “you
served me well once, but I can’t wait for you. I’d like
to stay to help you; but self-protection first, you know.
And it’s get out of here now for me, or a drumhead
court-martial and shot to death by rifle bullets as a
traitor; at any rate, I’ll be counted a traitor, when I
have put this thing through. I’m off for the nuggets;
and if you aren’t with me, why, then I shan’t have to
divide.”</p>

<p>As he lifted the girl, intending to hoist her to the
back of the horse, she came partly from out of the
fainting state in which she had so long been.</p>

<p>“Poor little girl!” he said. “Yet you’ll think I’m
the finest fellow in the world in a week or so, see if
you don’t. Just now I suppose you’d try to scratch my
eyes out, like dear Mother McGee, if you only could!
My efforts were always unappreciated.”</p>

<p>The desperate devil in his make-up had broken
bounds and now controlled him body and soul.</p>

<p>Barlow had been wild and reckless at school, and at
West Point, where he narrowly escaped being dismissed
in disgrace. He had gambled and drank, and
got away with the small fortune left to him by his
father, who was long since dead. In Baltimore he had
become mixed up in a quarrel of a disgraceful nature,
and had stabbed a man to death; but his friends swore
so glibly at the trial that he was acquitted on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
ground of self-defense. After that Barlow had tried
for a time to lead a more decent existence. He had
been sent out to this post on the Texas frontier. Then
he began to gamble and to drink again.</p>

<p>He laughed to himself as he lifted the girl; laughed
at the thought of outwitting the scout; laughed at the
consternation which his deed of desperation would
create in the fort; and while thus laughing cast a
glimpse into the near future.</p>

<p>“I’ll get that gold, and then off for some other country!”</p>

<p>The girl moaned as he threw her brutally on the
back of the horse and took the reins of the other
horses. Climbing into the saddle he held the girl in
front of him, and permitted the horses to walk quietly
out of the little trees and away over the soft grass,
which was so like a carpet that their hoofs made hardly
a sound.</p>

<p>Yet this sound Buffalo Bill heard, as he left Smallpox
Dave and started again in pursuit of Barlow.</p>

<p>But crafty Barlow, drawing rein and sitting in silence,
also heard the scout, and he drew the girl closer
to him.</p>

<p>“My dear, now we’re going to have a ride such as
you read about!”</p>

<p>She shivered as she came back to consciousness, or
at least partial consciousness.</p>

<p>“Where am I? And where are you taking me?”</p>

<p>“My dear May, you are with your ever-devoted
servant, and we are off for a little ride. We’ll make
it a pleasure trip, and perhaps there will be a wedding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
come of it very shortly. You don’t know me? Well,
just at present I’m Reckless Joe, known hitherto as
Lieutenant Joel Barlow. And here we go!”</p>

<p>He drove his spurs into the flanks of the horse he
was riding, lashed the others, and was soon riding
at wild speed away from the fort and straight out into
the deep darkness of the night.</p>

<p>He heard the whiplike report of a revolver, and
knew that Buffalo Bill had fired it to rouse the fort.</p>

<p>“Catch me who can!” he muttered. “It will be a
long race, and I know where I am going.”</p>

<span class="fs70">STARTLING NEWS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buffalo Bill knew that successful pursuit of Lieutenant
Barlow would be difficult. Barlow had a good
start, and the night was dark. Nevertheless, after
firing that shot intended to arouse the fort, he ran to
get his own horse, and found it gone.</p>

<p>He was searching for it when the palisade gate flew
open, and Corporal Clendenning and some troopers
rode forth, to see what the shooting meant.</p>

<p>The scout called to them.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to make accusations against an officer,”
he said, as they joined him, “yet I must ask that an
immediate pursuit of Lieutenant Barlow be made; and
I will lead, if you will furnish me with a horse. Mine
is gone.”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Barlow!” gasped the amazed Clendenning.</p>

<p>“There is a man out here whom I have captured,”
the scout went on. “A man came over the wall from
the inside with a girl in his arms, and this man tried
to help him. I failed to stop what seemed to be an
abduction; the abductor escaped, and took the girl
with him. The man who is now my prisoner confessed
that the other man was Lieutenant Barlow.
The girl is the young lady who was brought here
charged with the theft of that nugget. You will, I’m
sure, find her gone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span></p>

<p>They gathered round him, with astonished questions.</p>

<p>“But Lieutenant Barlow wouldn’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I ask for an investigation. Can any one find Barlow
in the fort, or find the young lady? Let a search
be made; and, meanwhile, some of you come with me
and see my prisoner.”</p>

<p>They found the rascal, Smallpox Dave, trying to
crawl away. He had made good progress, too, in spite
of his being bound; but he dropped back sullenly when
the scout and the troopers rode up to him.</p>

<p>“Tell these men what you told me,” the scout commanded;
“I mean the name of the man who came
over the wall with the young woman in his arms and
has now ridden away.”</p>

<p>Smallpox Dave’s wrath blazed out now like the flash
of a gunpowder explosion. A great oath ripped from
his lips.</p>

<p>“Yes, and cuss him for the coward he is; he’s cut
out, takin’ my hoss, as well as his!” he declared. “I’ll
settle with him fer that!”</p>

<p>“His name?” said the scout.</p>

<p>“His name? Why, it’s that lieutenant, Barlow!
And we was to work together, and I was to have half
of it, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The name of the girl?”</p>

<p>“Ther one he was sweet on&mdash;ther Arlington girl,
livin’ over yender on the prairies.”</p>

<p>“But there may be&mdash;must be&mdash;a mistake,” urged
Corporal Clendenning. “Lieutenant Barlow wouldn’t
do a thing of this kind. Besides, we can’t accept the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
word of such a man as this scoundrel. Cody, I’m
afraid you’re making a mistake, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Corporal Clendenning, you’re the man in command
here now. Give me some men to make a pursuit
with.”</p>

<p>“Cody, I shall&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Furnish me a horse, then. My own horse is lame
at present.”</p>

<p>“But Cody&mdash;&mdash;” objected Clendenning again.</p>

<p>“Can I have a horse? Every moment makes pursuit
more difficult.”</p>

<p>“In my opinion, Lieutenant Barlow is within the
fort now, and this man is lying,” said Clendenning.
“What his object is I don’t know.”</p>

<p>As Corporal Clendenning was unwilling to believe
the statement of Smallpox Dave, and so was reluctant
to furnish the scout with a horse before making an
investigation, Buffalo Bill returned into the grounds
of the fort with the troopers, taking his prisoner with
him.</p>

<p>They were no more than inside when Mrs. McGee
appeared, raging and almost hysterical.</p>

<p>“Oh, the thafe!” she cried. “That I should live to
see it, and that he should strike me in that way! Och,
whin I get me two hands on him I’ll choke him black
in the face! Who was it? ’Twas Lieutenant Barlow!
I’ve knowed he was that crooked he c’u’dn’t
walk straight! And it’s the gyurl he has taken wid
him, bad cess to his picture! I don’t understand it
at all, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There, Clendenning, is part of the proof you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
want!” said the scout. “Look for Lieutenant Barlow
here, and you’ll find him gone. Look for the girl here,
and you’ll find, likewise, that she is gone. Give me
a horse, so that I may go in pursuit, if you don’t dare
to take the responsibility of conducting such a pursuit
yourself.”</p>

<p>There was a stir beyond the palisade gate, together
with the challenge of a sentry.</p>

<p>“Who goes there?” the sentry asked.</p>

<p>The answer was sharp and clear:</p>

<p>“Wild Bill Hickok. My good friend, it’s so dark
that I don’t even know myself, but if you’ll speak that
name to Buffalo Bill, who I think is on the inside, he
may bring a lantern out here and light up my face
enough to recognize me.”</p>

<p>“Hickok!” cried Buffalo Bill, with joy. “The one
man above all others that I should most prefer to see
just now!”</p>

<p>He turned to the gate.</p>

<p>“That’s Wild Bill Hickok,” he said to the sentry.
“I know his voice, even if he hadn’t announced his
name. I’ll guarantee with my life that he is all right.”</p>

<p>Hickok was permitted to enter; and, as most of the
men there had seen him, and all had the highest regard
for him, there was almost an ovation as he came in
through the gate.</p>

<p>He was mounted, and he threw himself out of the
saddle to clasp the hand of his old pard, Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you&mdash;more than words can tell,
Hickok! What’s the news?”</p>

<p>“I came to bring it,” said Wild Bill, “and you’ll say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
it’s important. Half a hundred young Cheyennes
broke from the reservation last night and have gone
on the warpath. I’ve got news for you, too, Cody;
but I reckon it’ll have to wait.”</p>

<p>The news of the outbreak stirred the fort. But the
sensation it created was not so great as that caused
by the discovery that Lieutenant Barlow had departed
in that wildly sensational manner, bearing with him
the young woman who had been brought into the fort
but a few hours before as a prisoner, charged with the
theft of a gold nugget belonging to Colonel Montrose.</p>

<p>That they might know more of this, the troopers
gathered round Smallpox Dave, asking him questions.
But by this time Smallpox Dave had become cautious.
He was frightened. In telling of the wickedness of
Barlow he saw that he was only incriminating himself,
for he had assisted Barlow in the things he had
done. So now he refused to talk, and refused to answer
the questions that were hurled at him.</p>

<p>He was taken to the prison where Ben Stevens had
for some hours been held.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill went to that prison and succeeded in
getting Clendenning to release Stevens.</p>

<p>The young lover was frantic when he learned what
had befallen his sweetheart, May Arlington.</p>

<p>“Give me a horse,” he begged, “and I will follow
him alone!”</p>

<p>It was the cry that had been made by Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>Already the scout had made up his mind to set
forth, if in no other way, mounted with Wild Bill on
the back of Wild Bill’s horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span></p>

<p>But Clendenning now relented.</p>

<p>“I can furnish you a horse, Cody,” he said. “I beg
your pardon if I’ve been wrong, and I hope I’m not
wrong now. It all seems strange. I wish I could do
more, Cody; but you may have a horse, and as many
of them as you want.”</p>

<p>So much delay had resulted that it seemed almost
like making the proverbial search for a needle in a haystack
when Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill rode forth from
Fort Cimarron in pursuit of Lieutenant Barlow. With
them went the young cowboy, Ben Stevens.</p>

<p>“I’ll follow him to the ends of the earth!” said Stevens;
“and when I find him it’s his life or mine! This
world ain’t big enough to hold the two of us from this
on!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE SKY MIRROR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>With the aid of torches, an effort was made to pick
up the trail close by the fort.</p>

<p>The scouts found some hoofmarks, and from them
gained what they believed to be the general direction
of Barlow’s flight.</p>

<p>It was known, however, that Barlow was shrewd,
and the chances were good that he would change his
course after leaving the fort some distance behind
him.</p>

<p>When daylight came nothing was to be seen by the
scouts but the broad expanse of prairie grass lying
before them.</p>

<p>In that section of country the grass is not the tall
prairie grass of better-watered regions; but it is the
short “buffalo grass,” growing but an inch or two high.
It is fine and mossy in texture and of a gray-green in
color, and when the land is clothed with it the traveler
looks out on a gray-green expanse that widens before
him like a limitless carpet.</p>

<p>Here and there a few “groves,” or patches of mesquite,
a bush of the size of a small peach tree, broke
the otherwise illimitable sweep of the eye.</p>

<p>Besides these breaks of mesquite there were, as the
scouts knew, innumerable swales and “draws.” These
were low land, some being grassy depressions but a
few yards in diameter, others of much greater extent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
In addition, and resembling them, were the old “buffalo
wallows,” depressions which the buffaloes had
gouged out with their heads and horns in the rainy
seasons in their efforts to rid themselves of mosquitoes
and other insects.</p>

<p>The two scouts and their young companion sat
quietly on their horses and saw the sun rise out of this
grassy sea like a ball of red fire. It was truly a
glorious sight.</p>

<p>“Nothing down Panhandle way,” said Wild Bill, as
he looked southward into Texas&mdash;that portion of
Texas known as the “Panhandle.”</p>

<p>“And nothing over toward No Man’s Land,” said
Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>“No Man’s Land,” it may be said, is that extension
of the Indian Territory stretching between the Panhandle
of Texas and western Kansas. It was formerly
a possession of the Cherokee Indians, and was called
the “Cherokee Outlet,” or “The Neutral Strip.” Over
it the Cherokees were privileged to pass from their
reservation eastward to the hunting grounds of the
West. In later years, being a neglected and forsaken
country, with little pretensions to an exercise of legal
authority, it became the resort of desperadoes of all
sorts and degrees, and was known as “No Man’s
Land.” In it were a few towns with no recognized
legal standing, some cattle companies that were really
lawbreakers by being there, and certain Indians herded
on reservations. To these must be added outlaws and
“bad men” generally of the kind that infested the
frontier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span></p>

<p>But when Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill looked out on
its peaceful surface that morning, with the red sun
rising in the east as if it were a disk of red gold which
some giant hand was pushing up out of the ground,
there was nowhere a suggestion of anything unlawful,
of any bloodshed, or red ruins of the border.</p>

<p>Not an outlaw, not an Indian, not a soldier, was in
sight; nothing was visible except the three horsemen,
who sat their horses as if they were carved images and
who looked, with their horses, like figures in bronze, as
the gold of the sunlight fell on them.</p>

<p>“Nothing anywhere,” said Stevens, struggling inwardly
with despair and suspense.</p>

<p>He was a handsome fellow, this young cowboy, with
tanned face, clear, flashing blue eyes, muscular body,
and broad shoulders, with thick brown hair curling
under his wide-brimmed hat. He was such a man as
a woman would quickly learn to love.</p>

<p>“Nothing anywhere in sight, anyhow,” said Wild
Bill; “but that don’t prove that there ain’t any number
of redskins, or outlaws, or maybe peaceful folk, within
no more than a mile of us, hiding in some of the hollows
and draws.”</p>

<p>As if to show that this region was not wholly devoid
of life, at that moment a band of antelopes broke from
a ravine less than a mile away and went gamboling
over the short grass, furnishing as pretty a picture as
the eye could wish to see. The white patches on their
flanks glistened in the sunlight.</p>

<p>“No, Injuns, or other kind of cattle, over there,”
commented Wild Bill, when he saw them. “Or, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
there are, they’re lying too still for the antelopes to
see them.”</p>

<p>The antelopes swept on across the level land and
disappeared in another depression a mile or more
away.</p>

<p>“The thing we’ll have to do is to separate and look
for the trail,” said Buffalo Bill. “We can cover a
good deal of country in a couple of hours, and then
we can come together and compare notes.” He
glanced around again. “You see the mesquite grove
straight ahead, with the tall mesquite growing in the
center of it like a sentinel? What do you say for that
as our rendezvous?”</p>

<p>“Good enough!” assented Wild Bill. “We’ll meet
there in two hours and compare notes.”</p>

<p>“And if we strike the trail, either of us, let a pistol
shot announce the fact,” said Stevens; “and then the
others can join him.”</p>

<p>He was anxious to be in motion again&mdash;to be doing
something. His haggard face told how he had suffered
mentally during the night.</p>

<p>When this was agreed to, the three separated, riding
in different directions, each with eyes on the
ground, searching for the lost trail.</p>

<p>It was plain that Barlow, in his flight, had not stuck
to the direction he had taken in setting out, yet it
was likely, or possible, that he had merely deviated
from a direct line to baffle pursuit, and was really keeping
on in the same general direction.</p>

<p>An hour after this separation Buffalo Bill heard a
distant shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>

<p>“The signal!” he said. “And it’s from Hickok.
He has struck the trail.”</p>

<p>When he looked in the direction from which the
sound had come a blue, sealike expanse seemed to float
before him.</p>

<p>They had been numerous, those lakelike illusions,
and he knew what they were&mdash;the deceptive mirage of
the dry lands of the high plains. That blue “sea,”
and a sort of heatlike shimmer that hovered above
it, made it impossible now for him to see a mile in
the direction of the shot, whereas before those deceptive
things appeared the eye could range to the very
limit of vision. While trying to look through that
blue illusion he fancied he heard the distant trampling
of hoofs.</p>

<p>Instantly he dropped from the saddle to the ground
and laid an ear against the turf, to aid his hearing.</p>

<p>A confused trampling of hoofs reached him now,
and he thought he heard a yell, followed by another
shot, and then a volley.</p>

<p>Lying prone on the ground, the scout looked again
across the sealike levels of grass. Then he beheld
something that almost frightened him.</p>

<p>In the sky over that level grass land the picture of
a tragedy was thrown by that strange refractive power
of light which produces the mirage. The sky for the
moment had been changed to a mirror there, and in
that mirror was shown a scene that was being enacted
on the ground below.</p>

<p>A number of Indians were rushing on a white man.
He had evidently fired the cartridges out of his revolver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
and stood now at bay. The Indians, who were
Cheyennes, judging by their general appearance,
rushed upon the man with knives and struck him
down.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill stared, helpless, fascinated, by that terrible
scene. “It is Wild Bill!” he groaned; “and they
have killed him!”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill knew that he was looking at a scene in
a mirage, yet he knew as well that the mirage pictured
something that was happening at the moment. He
knew, too, that he was too far from it to be of any
immediate help to his old friend. Yet he jumped up
from the ground and leaped to the back of his horse.
Whether there were ten or a hundred of the red devils,
he was going to the aid of Wild Bill.</p>

<p>He drove his heels into the flanks of the horse and
sent it on with great bounds that bore it over the level
land with almost the fleetness of the wind.</p>

<p>Where Ben Stevens was at the moment he did not
know and had not time to inquire. All he knew was
that ahead of him somewhere Wild Bill was in peril
of his life, if not dead.</p>

<p>The blue heatlike shimmer before him still held up
its concealing veil, and the lakelike illusion still continued.</p>

<p>It was as if he were galloping toward a wide reach
of smoky blue water, yet this “water” fled ever before
him as he galloped on.</p>

<p>He knew he could never come up with it, for it
was of that miragy character which has more than
once lured thirsty travelers to death, as they followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
the blue vision, in the belief that it was a lake of real
water.</p>

<p>Mile after mile, until three were cast behind the
hoofs of his horse, did the scout ride on in that wild
way; the mirage changing its appearance constantly,
so that at one time it seemed a wide lake with islands,
and at other times a stream broken into innumerable
rivulets.</p>

<p>Then he rode down into a grassy swale, and there
saw trampled grass showing hoof marks.</p>

<p>He jumped from the saddle and bent over them.</p>

<p>“Just as I thought; Cheyennes!”</p>

<p>He stared about as if he half expected to see a
feathered head close by. He could not see far because
of the smoky haze that still lay on everything.</p>

<p>Soon he remounted, and began to follow that trail.</p>

<p>Two horses, or Indian ponies, had passed along.
They were unshod, and the scout was certain they
were Cheyenne ponies. Soon other trails joined these
two.</p>

<p>“Ah, here is where they first saw him!”</p>

<p>Other hoof marks had come in there; after which
there were evidences that all of the ponies had started
in a sudden burst of speed.</p>

<p>To the experienced eye of Buffalo Bill this was as
plain as the print in a primer. The Cheyennes had
here seen Wild Bill and had charged on him.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards beyond, the scout came to the
scene of the fight&mdash;the scene he had seen pictured so
clearly in the sky mirror. He looked the ground
over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span></p>

<p>“Here is where he made his stand,” he said, “for
here are the empty cartridge shells from his revolver;
and here is where they rushed on him, and captured
or killed him. It was hot work; for here are bloodstains,
and indications that somebody was killed, and
perhaps more than one. Of course, the Cheyennes
would carry away their dead and wounded. And it
will go hard with Hickok, for I guess he wiped out one
or more of them.”</p>

<p>He followed along, reading the signs, plain as print
to one as skilled as he.</p>

<p>“Here I think they set him on a horse, for the hoof
marks of this pony begin right here to sink deeper into
the ground, showing that an extra weight was put on
its back. Yes, they tied him here, for here are the
ends of rawhide cut from the thongs they put on him.”</p>

<p>The great scout and trailer stood up, his face
brighter and more hopeful. He had feared that soon
he would behold Wild Bill’s dead body.</p>

<p>“That proves that he wasn’t killed, and also shows
that he was not so badly injured but that they thought
they must tie him. Hickok forever! It’s hard to
down you, old pard of mine!”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill’s voice thrilled with the pride he felt in
the ability and achievements of his old and true friend
of the border.</p>

<p>“Yes, and they went in that direction. This is a
body of a young Cheyenne buck, I judge, which is
proof that they belong to the desperate young herd
that broke away from the reservation. They are not
returning to the reservation, though, but are heading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
toward the southwest. What does that mean? What
is in that direction?”</p>

<p>He followed the trail, keen-eyed and wary, leading
his horse by its bridle. He had no way of knowing
but that Cheyennes, eager for his blood, awaited him
in some grassy hollow, and would shoot him when he
came in range, or jump out upon him unawares and
tomahawk him. He was taking no more chances than
he was forced to. Yet he kept straight on, dragging
at the reins of his horse and keeping his eyes on the
trail, spelling out its meaning as he advanced.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, he saw that the blue mirages were
disappearing; the advance of the sun into the higher
sky was driving them away.</p>

<p>“The Cheyennes will have me in sight soon, if
they’re near; and they’re not so very far, that’s sure!”</p>

<p>He came to a hollow. Fortunately it was two or
three feet deep, and before it grew some mesquite
bushes.</p>

<p>He stopped in this hollow, and there picketed his
horse with his lariat, driving an iron pin into the
ground with his boot heel, and attaching to the pin the
lariat end.</p>

<p>He had no more than done so when the blue mirage
vanished.</p>

<p>It was a singular thing. A fog lifts or falls slowly,
and does not disappear for some time. But this was
almost uncanny in the quickness with which it disappeared.
At one time the blue sea of the mirage lay
before him, with the shimmery-heat appearance above
its surface. Five minutes later it was not there. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
had not gone anywhere&mdash;neither up nor down&mdash;but it
simply was no more to be seen. Where that blue sea,
or lake, had seemed to be, stretched now the level
grasslands, just as in the earlier hours of the morning,
when the rising sun shone on them, and the eye
could penetrate now to the limits of the horizon.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill ducked behind the screen of the mesquite
bushes, and he was glad he had taken the precaution
to conceal his horse. For there, two or three
miles away, was a band of mounted Indians.</p>

<p>The sun glistened on the tips of their spears and
tomahawks, and glittered on their gun barrels. Feathers
floated from the manes and tails of their ponies,
and feathers floated from the plumed headgear of the
warriors.</p>

<p>The scout unslung the field glass he usually carried,
and leveled it, lying again prone in the grass and
looking out from behind the mesquite.</p>

<p>The powerful glass drew the Indians well within
range of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, Cheyennes,” he said, “and young bucks from
the reservation; and they’ve got Hickok, more’s the
pity! Those young rascals are out for scalps and
plunder. When they get ‘good’ again, they’ll hurry
back to the reservation, slip in some dark night, and
swear that they have never been away from it a minute.”</p>

<p>Wild Bill rode upright and seemed not to be seriously
hurt, as Buffalo Bill was glad to observe.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill even fancied that with the glass he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
could see the proud and defiant look that he knew
was on the face of Wild Bill.</p>

<p>The Cheyennes saw neither Buffalo Bill nor his
horse.</p>

<p>The scout swept the surrounding country with the
glass, looking for Ben Stevens, but saw nothing of
him; those Indians were the only things moving, or
visible.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has seen them and has got under cover,
just as I have,” was Buffalo Bill’s thought. He knew
that Stevens, as a cowboy, was not inexperienced. He
was a good borderman and understood Indian ways,
and what to do in emergencies. The cowboy life
makes one quick of thought, and it does not breed
weaklings.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill lay behind the screen of the mesquite,
watching the young Cheyennes until they were out
of sight. He saw that they were heading steadily toward
the Southwest, and that they were hurrying.</p>

<p>Apparently they feared a pursuit of troopers from
the fort; and for that reason, though they probably
knew that Wild Bill was not the only white man out
on those level grasslands, they feared to tarry or go
after those others.</p>

<p>The troops of the government inspired a good deal
of fear and respect in the minds of the Indians, and
not even bloodthirsty young bucks, who usually were
ready for any deviltry or bloodshed, cared to meet
them.</p>

<p>“Heading straight southwest. Oh, yes, there is another
band of Cheyennes on the border of the Territory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
of New Mexico! Perhaps they are intending to
join them. The thing is likely. And then they’ll stir
up trouble on that border. I wish I could get word
of this to the fort.”</p>

<p>The important thing now was to follow the trail of
the Cheyennes and see what could be done to effect
the rescue of Wild Bill. Yet Buffalo Bill knew that
it would but jeopardize the chances if he began an
open pursuit, or showed himself so that the Cheyennes
would see him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was tedious and wearing work to lie
there and see those young Indians riding out of sight
with his old friend.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to meet Stevens at the agreed rendezvous,
and then together we’ll strike the Cheyenne trail and
hold it until we do something. Or if he won’t go on,
I’ll have to go alone. But there’s that rascally lieutenant
and the girl to find. If I were about a dozen
men just now I think I wouldn’t be too many for the
need.”</p>

<p>The Cheyennes were now out of sight behind a roll
in the land, and the scout drew the picket pin, and
mounting, set out for the point where the three friends
had promised to meet.</p>

<p>He set the horse at a sharp gallop, for he was anxious
to follow the Cheyennes.</p>

<p>“If he isn’t there I’ll leave written word for him,
so posted that he can’t fail to see it when he comes,
and then I’ll push on after the Indians,” was his conclusion,
as he thus rode forth.</p>

<span class="fs70">BARLOW AND THE GIRL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>While Buffalo Bill was thus riding toward the rendezvous
to meet Ben Stevens, and the Cheyennes were
riding hard toward the Southwest with Wild Bill in
their midst as a prisoner, the dastardly young lieutenant,
Joel Barlow, and the girl he had abducted so
boldly from Fort Cimarron, were pursuing their separate
ways.</p>

<p>May Arlington recovered from her swooning condition
after Barlow had gone some distance, and she began
to ask questions, which were rather hazy at first,
but became sharp and pointed when she more clearly
understood just where she was and recalled what had
happened.</p>

<p>Barlow was lying like Ananias, in order to deceive
her and make her think his motives honorable.</p>

<p>“It’s on account of the Cheyennes,” he said.</p>

<p>At the same time, so far as he was concerned, this
was a bare falsehood, for he did not then know that
the young bucks had left the reservation and gone on
the warpath.</p>

<p>A horrible fear gripped the heart of the girl, at that
mention of Cheyennes; yet she was of the courageous
border kind, and soon she was again asking questions
and demanding answers.</p>

<p>“If the Cheyennes are out, then the fort would be
the safest place for me,” she urged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span></p>

<p>“That’s because you don’t understand the situation,”
he told her. “I understand it thoroughly. The
fort can’t be held against them. It’s nothing but an
old hulk, and has been so for a long time. The palisades
are rotten and are ready to fall down. The Indians
can beat them down without trouble.”</p>

<p>“If that is so, why haven’t you and the other troopers
done something to repair the palisades?”</p>

<p>“Just the dry rot of carelessness,” he said. “The
Indians have been peaceable so long that no one could
believe there would ever again be trouble; and so the
walls have been neglected, and everything is in as bad
a shape as it can be.</p>

<p>“I saw the danger you would be in,” he went on.
“You are young, and you are a handsome girl; some
buck would take you for his squaw as soon as he saw
you. That’s why I’m getting you away from there.”</p>

<p>She stiffened in his arms. She did not believe him.</p>

<p>“Let me down, please!” she requested.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Because I know that you are lying, and I refuse
to go farther with you.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear girl&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What black scheme have you in mind now?” she
demanded.</p>

<p>“May Arlington, you wrong me! I have no plan.
I’m doing this because I want to help you, and because
I love you.”</p>

<p>“You have left Mrs. McGee; and Ben Stevens is in
that jail there, a prisoner and helpless.”</p>

<p>“I meant to save you, at any rate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span></p>

<p>“I will not go with you. Unhand me.” She struggled
in his arms.</p>

<p>“Don’t be foolish, May!” he said. “What would
you do?”</p>

<p>“Let me have one of the horses, and I’ll return to
the fort.”</p>

<p>“Alone? In the darkness?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Give me one of the horses.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll walk.”</p>

<p>He held her tight, and her struggles were useless.
But she was making trouble, for the horse was growing
restive.</p>

<p>“Stop it!” he commanded.</p>

<p>“I will not stop it! Release me!”</p>

<p>“See here,” he said, “I know what I’m doing.”</p>

<p>“And I know what you are intending. You’re carrying
me away into the darkness, and where you’re
going with me I don’t know. But I won’t go with
you.”</p>

<p>“I’m taking you to safety!” he protested.</p>

<p>“Let me down!” she begged.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Whoa!” she cried to the horses.</p>

<p>He struck the spurs into the one he rode, and it
started on with such a jump that he was almost thrown
out of the saddle.</p>

<p>She began to scream then, though they were so far
from the fort by this time that her screams could not
reach it.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to force you to stop that, if you don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
stop it yourself,” he threatened. His anger was growing.</p>

<p>In spite of the threat she screamed the louder, and
threshed about so violently that he began to fear he
could not hold her on the horse.</p>

<p>In the midst of this there was a clatter of pony
hoofs, and a mass of dark riders loomed before them
as if they had leaped out of the ground. The next
minute Barlow and the girl were in the midst of a
body of Cheyennes.</p>

<p>The young Indians clutched the horses by the
bridles and threw them back on their haunches. They
pressed close up to the riders, and grunted when they
saw that one of them was a girl and the other an
officer of the army.</p>

<p>“What do?” the leader asked in broken English.</p>

<p>The cries of the girl had drawn them, though it
seemed probable they would have heard Barlow in his
flight any way.</p>

<p>Barlow was himself very much startled and frightened.
However, he took courage, for the Indian who
spoke to him, he discovered, was one he knew; a young
buck he had once aided, and with whom since he had
been more or less on terms of friendship.</p>

<p>“See here!” he shouted. “Is that you, Red Wing?”</p>

<p>Red Wing and the other young Cheyennes grunted.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Red Wing? I’m Barlow, you know&mdash;Lieutenant
Barlow, at the fort.”</p>

<p>Red Wing pushed nearer. All the girl could see in
the darkness was the outline of his feathered head and
the glitter of his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span></p>

<p>“What got?” said Red Wing, peering at the girl,
who shrank from him.</p>

<p>“This is my sister, Red Wing. We were on our
way to the home of a friend who lives out here. You’ll
let us go on?”</p>

<p>The other Cheyennes began to murmur.</p>

<p>Their restive, prancing ponies, the guttural talk, and
exclamations, the fluttering of their feathers, combined
in the darkness to give to the girl such feelings
of terror that she could hardly keep from again
screaming outright.</p>

<p>“The Wolf Soldier speaks with a straight tongue?”
questioned Red Wing.</p>

<p>The other Cheyennes set up a clamor, fearing the
prisoners were to be released. These were the first
white people they had encountered in their efforts at
raiding, and they did not want them to slip through
their fingers now.</p>

<p>“I speak with a straight tongue, Red Wing,” Barlow
protested. “She is my sister, and we are going to
visit a friend.”</p>

<p>But they were not to be permitted to go on.</p>

<p>“Wolf Soldier stay with me, and she stay with me,”
was the announcement, whereupon the Cheyennes
closed in about their prisoners.</p>

<p>But because the Wolf Soldier was known to Red
Wing, the prisoners were not tied, nor were they
treated to any savage brutality, as would otherwise
have been the case.</p>

<p>“Steady now!” Barlow whispered in the ear of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
girl. “I told you that the Cheyennes were on the
warpath, which you doubted. We have blundered into
a body of them. But luckily I know their leader. He
is a young buck I once saved from a wolf, after he
had been badly scratched up by the brute, and he
hasn’t forgot it. It’s the thing that will help us, and
finally save us. But you’ll have to do as I say, or we’ll
never come out of this alive.”</p>

<p>He wanted to impress the girl with a sense of her
danger, and also with a sense of his truthfulness and
kindly intentions.</p>

<p>The Cheyennes moved forward, clustering round
the prisoners.</p>

<p>Having secured temporarily his own safety, and
also having no longer to contend with the frantic
struggles of May Arlington, whom fright had subjugated
for the time, Barlow transferred her to one
of his led horses, and so was rid of her weight, which
had begun to grow irksome.</p>

<p>Now that she was actually in the hands of the savages
whom she had so long dreaded, May Arlington
began to show something of the spirit of a heroine.
She did not know how much of Barlow’s statements
were true or false, but she did know that she was a
prisoner of the Cheyennes.</p>

<p>Apparently Barlow’s statement that they had gone
on the warpath were true. Judging by that, it might
be that his statement that he was taking her from the
fort in order to protect her was also true, though she
could not yet believe it. But whatever was true or
false, she realized that she must try now to escape;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
and to do that she would need all her strength, energy,
and coolness.</p>

<p>She must, therefore, learn self-control! No longer
could she throw herself about, as she had been doing,
for that was exhausting. It would also be quite useless
with these Indians. Their bloody practice was to
bury a tomahawk in the head of a prisoner if that
prisoner became troublesome.</p>

<p>She bent toward Barlow as the cavalcade galloped
on. “Can we escape?” she whispered.</p>

<p>He leaned toward her, to hear what she said; and
she repeated the question.</p>

<p>“I think so, later,” he whispered in answer. “We
shall have to be careful. They’re treating us well now
because of what I did for Red Wing; but if they find
us tricky they’ll be severe with us. I’m trying to think
out a plan. I’ll save you; and some day you will
know that I’m not the black devil you’ve been thinking
me.”</p>

<p>That was a long and wearing ride for May Arlington;
it taxed her strength to the utmost.</p>

<p>To be hurried forward through the gloom of night
surrounded by feathered Indians who are on the warpath,
having for a companion a white man whose actions
had been brutal and seemed to be treacherous,
was a situation about as bad as can be conceived.</p>

<p>Yet May Arlington tried to endure it without a
murmur, and even tried to cherish hope, and to think
of some plan herself whereby a release might be
brought about.</p>

<p>When daylight came the Indians were still in motion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
and the girl was almost ready to drop from her
saddle.</p>

<p>Some time afterward the Cheyennes sighted a horseman,
and contrived to get out of sight in a big “draw”
without being seen by him.</p>

<p>The horseman was Wild Bill.</p>

<p>When he came near enough they charged him, and
a sharp fight ensued. Two of the Indians were killed
and another wounded; and then Wild Bill was at their
mercy.</p>

<p>It was the fight and the capture which Buffalo Bill
saw in the sky mirror.</p>

<p>The Indians in their rage and revenge would have
slain Wild Bill, but they recognized him as a scout
and one of the pards of the dreaded Long Hair, as
Buffalo Bill was known to them. Therefore, instead
of killing him outright, they simply brandished their
weapons about his head in efforts to frighten him,
and reserved him for a more horrible fate later.</p>

<p>Long before this time Lieutenant Barlow had apparently
set up amicable relations with the Cheyennes.
Even the exhausted and alarmed girl noticed it. He
was not treated as a prisoner, but more as if he were
one of them. Red Wing rode much of the time at his
side, and conversed with him, sometimes in Cheyenne,
a language with which he was familiar, strangely
familiar it seemed to May Arlington.</p>

<p>The bodies of the slain Indians were tied to the
backs of ponies. The wounded Indian was borne in
a blanket slung hammock-wise between two ponies;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
a position that must have brought him pain, although
he gave no sign of it.</p>

<p>Wild Bill had been tied hand and foot, and a rope
wound round the body of the horse to which he was
tied held his legs under the horse’s belly. He observed
that Barlow and the girl were not bound.</p>

<p>Barlow put his horse finally by his side.</p>

<p>“Sorry to see you here, Hickok,” he said, with professed
sympathy. “I’m a prisoner, too, and I was
afraid to try to get nearer to you sooner. Some of
the Cheyennes suspect me; but I have the good will
of the chief, because I saved him once from a wolf.
On account of that he calls me the Wolf Soldier.”</p>

<p>Wild Bill looked hard at him.</p>

<p>“It’s a good name, I think; that young Indian must
be a fine character reader. The Wolf Soldier just
about fits you.”</p>

<p>Barlow’s face turned red. “What do you mean?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“That you <em>are</em> a wolf soldier, or a wolfish one, as
you please. I understand how you happen to be here.
You’re on good terms with these red villains, because
you’re a renegade.”</p>

<p>“This is insulting, Hickok,” said Barlow; “but considering
your excitement, and your position, I’ll not
hold it against you. I don’t know what you’ve heard,
I’m sure; but I know that what you say wrongs me,
cruelly wrongs me.”</p>

<p>Wild Bill lifted his voice recklessly, and shouted to
the girl:</p>

<p>“My dear young lady, don’t trust this rascally lieutenant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
a minute, nor believe anything he says; he’s a
wolf in sheep’s clothing, and these Cheyennes hit his
character right when they call him the Wolf Soldier.”</p>

<p>A cry of rage broke from Barlow.</p>

<p>“Hickok,” he shouted, “you lie; you lie like a dog!”</p>

<p>The hot blood reddened the face of the bound man.</p>

<p>“You’ll have a chance to take that back, if these red
gentlemen don’t make short work of me,” he said.
“Never does any man tell me to my teeth that I’m a
liar, and afterward live to brag about it. He’ll meet
me with pistols in hand, and one or the other of us will
turn up his toes to the daisies. You’ve heard of Wild
Bill.”</p>

<p>Barlow’s face paled. Wild Bill, the dead shot of
the West, did have rather an unenviable reputation as
a dead shot and a duelist; and it was said that he was
quick to resent an insult, and would fight to the death
at the drop of a hat. His black, sparkling eyes glittered
now in a way to make Barlow quail. Yet Barlow
reflected that this Western dead shot was a prisoner
of the Cheyennes now, and that the chances of
his getting away and avenging the insult were very
slim.</p>

<p>Barlow could afford to smile at the impotent rage
of Wild Bill at that time.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard what I said, Miss Arlington,” Wild
Bill shouted again. “This wolf soldier is a traitor.
He has turned renegade and joined the Indians. Believe
nothing he says. But look out for yourself. I
may go under, as he has it in for me, and these red
fiends hate me worse than the devil hates holy water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
So my chances are not good. But I want you to know
the truth, if I’m to go under, that you may look out
for yourself as well as you can.”</p>

<p>With a snarling curse Barlow rode closer and
seemed about to strike him, when Red Wing broke
through, and with the flat of his tomahawk smashed
the redoubtable and courageous scout in the face. The
blow was not delivered with force enough to be bone-breaking,
but it made a red outline of the tomahawk
blade on the bruised flesh.</p>

<p>“White man keep tongue still or me cut it out!”
Red Wing shouted.</p>

<p>Wild Bill subsided, having given his warning.</p>

<p>He was sure that Barlow had become a renegade,
and he was sure also that it was in part Barlow’s influence
that was heading these young Cheyennes toward
the Southwest and away from Fort Cimarron.
Barlow was no more anxious to have the troopers
from the fort overtake these Cheyennes than were the
Cheyennes themselves.</p>

<p>“I never yet knew a renegade that didn’t end badly,”
was Wild Bill’s thought. “Deviltry generally gets
paid in its own kind. But I’ll help that girl, and protect
her with my life, if I can. Anyway, I couldn’t
do less than shout to her that warning.”</p>

<p>Barlow was returning to the girl’s side; he wanted
to say something to counteract Wild Bill’s accusation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="fs70">A DARING RUSE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Barlow and the Cheyennes knew that they would be
pursued without delay.</p>

<p>When a band of fiery young Indians break away
from a reservation, the first thing to do is to send
troopers after them, to bring them back, or whip them
into subjection before they have time to do any harm.</p>

<p>In addition, the flight of Barlow from Fort Cimarron
with the girl who had been held there on the false
charge of the theft of the nugget would send pursuers
after him.</p>

<p>All this Buffalo Bill likewise knew. And he knew,
further, that one of the things pursued Indians are
likely to do is to trap their pursuers.</p>

<p>After the scout had rejoined the young cowboy,
Ben Stevens, he and Stevens drove hard after the
retreating Cheyennes, watching for one of these traps.</p>

<p>While making this pursuit, and watching for ambuscades,
the scout left telltale signs along the trail,
which should direct the troopers whom he expected
would soon follow. On one or two high points he
planted signals, thrusting mesquite bushes up so they
would attract attention, and to these mesquites tying
written messages, which told all that he knew.</p>

<p>The retreating Cheyennes set no traps, being in too
great haste. But shortly after nightfall they halted
for a bit of rest, in a considerable grove of mesquite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
where they cautiously built fires and cooked some
food.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was not far behind them, and his keen
eyes caught the gleam of their hidden camp fires. He
had been over this trail before, and he had surmised
that they would go into camp at this spot, and accordingly
he had been making some plans.</p>

<p>He now took Ben Stevens’ horse, which had all the
characteristics of an Indian pony, removed the saddle,
and for its bridle substituted an Indian one taken
from the pouches of his saddle. This Indian bridle
was a very simple affair, consisting of rawhide thongs,
with a rawhide to be placed through the mouth and
round the lower jaw for a bit.</p>

<p>Behind his saddle the scout had carried an Indian
blanket.</p>

<p>His hat and his boots and some of his clothing he
concealed in a hole on the prairie, which he marked
with a stick.</p>

<p>From the saddle pouches came also head feathers,
Indian paints, and beaded moccasins. Putting on
these, the scout was soon transformed, with the further
aid of the Indian blanket, into a very presentable
specimen of the Cheyenne Indian. His mustache and
imperial could not be so well concealed, but he held
the blanket up round his mouth in the Indian fashion,
and these facial ornaments were not observable in the
night.</p>

<p>Thus attired and disguised, and mounted on Stevens’
Indian pony, the scout could not have been distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
from an Indian a yard away in the darkness.</p>

<p>After he had made this hasty but rather remarkable
transformation, Buffalo Bill held out his hand to the
young cowboy.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” he said, squeezing Stevens’ hand. “I’m
going into danger, and we may not meet again. But
I’ll save the young lady, if the thing can be done; and
Wild Bill, too. Look out for yourself. If you hear
the whistle of the bull elk, you’ll know you’re to make
the fake charge on the Cheyenne camp and stir things
up to draw attention from me. And look out that
they don’t capture you, while you’re hovering outside.”</p>

<p>He sprang to the bare back of the pony, drew the
blanket closely round his shoulders, and rode silently
through the darkness in the direction of the Cheyenne
supper camp.</p>

<p>He knew the Cheyennes would be moving on again
shortly.</p>

<p>He circled the camp, so as to approach it from the
other direction; and was guided in his work by now
and then seeing a flash from one of the sputtering fires
where the Cheyennes were roasting their meat. They
had brought down an antelope during the afternoon,
and they were preparing for a feast, which never
comes amiss to the stomach of an Indian.</p>

<p>When he was close up to the camp the scout slid to
the ground, and then led his pony on, with hand
held ready to catch it by the nose, if it showed signs
of wanting to neigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span></p>

<p>Off at one side, in a grassy space where the mesquite
did not grow, he discovered the Cheyenne ponies feeding.
They kept close together, and he was sure from
that that a herder had them in charge, though this
herder he could not see.</p>

<p>The Cheyenne ponies fed slowly toward him. One
of them snorted, and then neighed; and at that a
young Indian was seen by the scout gliding among
them.</p>

<p>The motion of the Indian set the ponies to moving,
and they drifted toward the scout, and soon he was
in the midst of a small group of them.</p>

<p>This suited him, for when they began to feed again,
putting their heads to the ground, he permitted his
pony to feed along with them; and he kept his body
and head close down to the earth, that he might not
be seen by the herder.</p>

<p>The feasting at the Indian camp fire lasted longer
than he had thought it would; the Cheyennes had made
a good ride that day, and as they ate they were planning
and boasting of the red work they intended to
do along the New Mexican border, after they had
joined their fellow tribesmen down there and had
stirred them to go on the warpath.</p>

<p>But at last they were ready to move again. The
scout’s keen ears apprised him of the fact, when they
called some questions to the pony herder, and the
herder shouted back to them.</p>

<p>A number of young Cheyennes streamed out from
the camp, and began to get their ponies and lead them
toward the fires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span></p>

<p>The time for which the scout had waited so long
had come. He, too, led his pony along; and with his
Indian disguise and blanket he seemed but one of the
Cheyennes leading in his pony.</p>

<p>When the Cheyennes mounted and were ready to
move on with their prisoners, the scout was mounted
and in their midst, and they did not know that a rider
had been added to their number; they could not have
told that without making a count, and they did not
think to do that; in truth, they did not once suspect
that an enemy was in their midst, or near.</p>

<p>As the Cheyennes thus rode forth again in the darkness,
heading still toward the Southwest, Buffalo Bill
rode with them, silent and watchful.</p>

<p>He understood the Cheyenne tongue, as he did most
of the Indian languages and dialects of the border,
and he was ready with answers, if questioned by any
one. But he was not questioned.</p>

<p>By careful work he located the prisoners, and by
work as careful he edged his pony by degrees toward
them, nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Wild Bill did not dream that his old border pard
was within miles, and he was rather startled when a
gruff Indian voice ordered him in Cheyenne to sit up
straighter, and then the Indian who gave the order
bent toward him and whispered, in the voice of Buffalo
Bill:</p>

<p>“It is I, Cody; I’m one of them, you know! But
mum’s the word. I’ll get you and the young lady out
of this. Stevens is outside, keeping shady, but hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
to the flanks of this party, and stands ready to
help me when I summon him.”</p>

<p>Wild Bill gulped with astonishment. His heart
jumped into his throat, he was so amazed. He was
familiar with the daring and cleverness of Buffalo
Bill, but he had not expected this. It came almost as
a shock.</p>

<p>“Can I tell the girl?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“If you find chance; but be careful. There you are!
Take this.”</p>

<p>The supposed Indian, lifting himself, for he had apparently
been examining the bonds of the white man,
spoke again to him in harsh, guttural words of reproof.</p>

<p>In reality, Buffalo Bill had slipped a keen knife
through those cords, and Wild Bill sat on the back of
his pony, free, the cords dropping unnoticed to the
ground as the pony moved on.</p>

<p>Then the knife itself was thrust into Wild Bill’s
hands. Following this came a loaded revolver&mdash;a
weapon which the Western dead shot knew as well
how to use as any man on the wild frontier.</p>

<p>The possession of those weapons made another man
of Wild Bill. With a good revolver in his hand, and
a knife ready, he was ready to fight his weight in
wild cats at any time; and that meant, in the Western
style of speech, that he was afraid of nothing on
earth.</p>

<p>That suspicion might not be attracted to him, Buffalo
Bill now drew his pony back, while Wild Bill
spoke to the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span></p>

<p>“A fine evening,” he said, in his musical voice.
“This is an evening when one likes to see friends. It
would not surprise me if friends were near. The stars
up there look friendly, and the mist we have been having
is clearing away.”</p>

<p>He spoke in English, enigmatically, that no Cheyenne
understanding English might comprehend, hoping
that the girl would know what he meant, or at least
get ready for an emergency. Then he carelessly
pushed his hand against her arm, extending the knife
given him by the scout.</p>

<p>“If one only had weapons!” he said, with meaning.</p>

<p>She felt the pressure of the knife against her arm.</p>

<p>Because she had been with the Wolf Soldier, who
was a friend of Red Wing, the girl had not been tied.
The Wolf Soldier, otherwise Barlow, rode not far off;
and he, like the girl, was not tied.</p>

<p>Though astonished and startled, the girl grasped the
knife.</p>

<p>“The stars are friendly,” she said, being quick of
comprehension. She did not know how it had been
done, but she knew that Wild Bill’s hands were free,
and that he had given her his knife.</p>

<p>“If one of the stars should fall, I should not be surprised,”
he said. “In fact, I’m always prepared not
to be surprised at anything.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me you’re finding your tongue,
Hickok!” Barlow grumbled.</p>

<p>“As I’m not addressing my interesting remarks to
you, I do not know that they call for an answer from
you,” Wild Bill retorted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span></p>

<p>“You’re still believing that nonsense, that I’m in
with these redskins?” said Barlow, who was chagrined
by Wild Bill’s curt reply.</p>

<p>“I don’t waste my breath on renegades,” said Wild
Bill scornfully.</p>

<p>Red Wing, hearing the words, began to edge near,
and Wild Bill dropped the unprofitable discussion.</p>

<p>“Does the Wolf Soldier want the white scout lashed
with a whip?” Red Wing asked, as if he longed to do
that lashing.</p>

<p>Barlow wanted to say “Yes;” but he knew it was
not then politic to do so.</p>

<p>“He is a fool!” he said. “His words are but wind,
Red Wing, and I do not hear them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is a fool!” Red Wing agreed.</p>

<p>“Aye, that he is, Red Wing! I wonder that the ears
of the jackass do not grow on his head. They would
fit him.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill was hearing all this, for he was riding
not three yards from the speakers; yet never was he
suspected, for the Indian blankets and his disguise concealed
him effectively.</p>

<p>Then the unexpected happened. A genuine bull elk
whistled out in front.</p>

<p>It was the signal Ben Stevens had been awaiting&mdash;the
whistle of a bull elk, from Buffalo Bill, and he
thought this came from the scout. Thereupon he
charged wildly on the flank, firing his revolvers, and
yelling in his most startling fashion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE CHEYENNE STAMPEDE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The sudden, unexpected, and astonishing demonstration
of Ben Stevens had a tremendous effect. It
threw the young Cheyennes into a panic.</p>

<p>They had been expecting pursuit by the troopers;
and, though they had felt sure none had been made,
or, at least, that no troopers were near, this seemed
to prove that the troopers had pursued and were now
charging. And a charge of United States troopers,
made in that way on a hostile Indian camp in the darkness
of the night, was a thing before which Indians
had never been able to stand. There was always
something so irresistible in its character that it seemed
to sweep them off their feet like the blast of a hurricane.</p>

<p>The Cheyennes bunched together, yelling, and began
to shoot into the darkness in the direction of the yells
and the revolver fire.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill’s time for action had come. He jerked
at the rein of the horse which carried the girl, turning
it about; and he yelled to Wild Bill:</p>

<p>“Now is the time!”</p>

<p>The words he used were in the Blackfeet Indian
tongue, and were not understood by the Cheyennes,
though they were understood by Wild Bill as well as
if they had been English words.</p>

<p>Wild Bill yelled back in the same tongue, to show
that he understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span></p>

<p>It seemed that the effort would be successful.</p>

<p>As Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill turned their horses
about, Buffalo Bill dragging at the rawhide rein of
the bridle of the horse ridden by the girl, a half dozen
of the young Cheyennes turned in the same direction.</p>

<p>In a flash Buffalo Bill, by his quick movement, had
become their leader, showing them by his movement
the direction in which they should ride, though that
was far enough from his intent. And so, pell-mell,
through the darkness, rode Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill
and the half dozen young Cheyenne bucks, who were
in a frenzy of excitement and fear, thinking that the
troopers were upon them.</p>

<p>They screamed their yells, and, whirling around on
the backs of their ponies, they poured a stream of rifle
and revolver shots in the direction of the firing of Ben
Stevens.</p>

<p>This bunching and crowding together of the Cheyennes
and of the horses ridden by the scouts and the
girl, caused some wild stumbles and much fractious
rearing of the horses.</p>

<p>The other Indians were riding wildly through the
darkness, as could be told by the thunder of hoofs.
The Cheyenne party had been suddenly split open as
if it had been struck by a tornado. And all by the
reckless daring of one white man, who seemed able,
in his yelling and shooting, to make as much noise as
if there were a dozen men about to charge!</p>

<p>The rein of rawhide which Buffalo Bill held was
jerked from his hand; but he shouted to the girl, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
in English, telling her to follow, and to keep close
by him.</p>

<p>Her horse stumbled; and the scout stopped and
again got hold of the rein.</p>

<p>The darkness caused indescribable confusion.</p>

<p>“This way!” Buffalo Bill yelled to his pard, again
in Blackfoot.</p>

<p>Wild Bill shouted back; and they tore thus through
the crowding and scrambling mob of frightened Indians,
who fell apart, thus giving a free passage.</p>

<p>The darkness had grown so dense that they could
see nothing clearly; but when they had ridden two or
three hundred yards in that wild way they drew rein,
the horses panting.</p>

<p>“All right?” asked the scout.</p>

<p>“All right here,” Wild Bill answered.</p>

<p>“Are you all right, Miss Arlington?” the scout
asked.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill rode close to her horse, struck by a sudden
fear.</p>

<p>She was not on the horse!</p>

<p>“Good Heaven,” he cried to Wild Bill, “the girl
isn’t here!”</p>

<p>“No?” Wild Bill was equally astonished.</p>

<p>“No, she isn’t here; and I was sure all the time she
was with us.”</p>

<p>“She fell from her horse in the rush and crush,”
said Wild Bill, surprised and troubled.</p>

<p>They sat listening.</p>

<p>The yells of Ben Stevens had died away, and now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
the Indians were yelling to each other, for they were
beginning to discover that they had been in a foolish
panic.</p>

<p>There were no charging troopers near, so far as
they could discover; at least, no large body of them;
otherwise, as they knew, the troopers would have pursued,
and would have been pistoling and sabering right
in their midst. But even yet they did not know just
what had happened.</p>

<p>Red Wing was calling loudly to some of his braves.
Near him Lieutenant Barlow was shouting to the
girl. Yet his voice showed that he did not know
where she was. Ben Stevens had utterly subsided.</p>

<p>“What next?” said Wild Bill.</p>

<p>“We will have to work our way back from where
we came, in the hope of finding her. If she is hurt, she
is lying near the line of our flight. Can we follow it
back in the darkness?”</p>

<p>“We can try,” said Wild Bill.</p>

<p>They turned their horses about.</p>

<p>“Too bad that this happened,” said Wild Bill, “just
when we had the thing cinched. She may have been
hurt, struck by a bullet or an arrow, or may have been
badly hurt by her fall.”</p>

<p>They rode slowly back over the way they had come,
trying hard to keep to the direct line of their flight.</p>

<p>Soon they saw some of the Cheyennes, dimly in the
darkness; and then they were almost in the midst of
them. One who rode close to Buffalo Bill shouted to
him.</p>

<p>“What was it?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span></p>

<p>The scout answered promptly, in Cheyenne:</p>

<p>“I know not. It may have been some of the spirits
of the Moonlight Mountains.”</p>

<p>Indians are proverbially afraid of spirits; and, in
the darkness, their superstitions are sometimes easily
excited.</p>

<p>The Moonlight Mountains were near, and mountains
are by many Indians, particularly plains Indians,
supposed to be filled with strange spirits, or ghosts.</p>

<p>The Cheyenne who had called to the scout mumbled
something; and the scout knew his words had made an
impression.</p>

<p>Wild Bill bent low on his saddle, and rode bare-headed;
for he had no blanket with which to disguise
himself, to make him look like an Indian.</p>

<p>As they thus rode slowly along, at intervals the
scouts slid to the ground, and felt about in the gloom,
calling to the girl in low voices. This was safe
enough, for the Cheyennes were making a horrible
babel with their yelling and questioning of each other.
But the girl could not be found; Barlow had subsided;
and when the scouts had gone as far as they believed
was necessary, and saw before them the gleaming
embers of the camp fires, they were ready to confess
themselves baffled.</p>

<p>“We’ll go back over the same way, and spread
apart a little. We must make a thorough search,”
said Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>They returned along the line of their search, dismounting
more frequently, and making a more complete
hunt; but the result was the same as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span></p>

<p>The Cheyennes were now bunching not far off, and
were yelling and calling, to summon all the members
of the band.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they have captured her again,” said
Buffalo Bill reluctantly.</p>

<p>“We might edge closer in and see,” Wild Bill suggested.</p>

<p>“I’ll do so; it will be safer for me. You hang
around out here. I’ll join you soon. I must see if
the girl is there.”</p>

<p>Wild Bill did not like to be separated from his pard,
but he saw the wisdom of the proposal.</p>

<p>Poor as the light was, the Indians, with their keen
eyes, were likely to spot him as a white man, if he
came too near them.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill, with his blanket and head feathers,
could more readily fool them. Hence he rode slowly
toward the Indians, and when one of them spoke to
him, he answered in Cheyenne of such excellence that
the redskin was thoroughly deceived.</p>

<p>In order to determine if the girl was a prisoner, he
rode into the very midst of the chattering group, and
looked about as well as he could.</p>

<p>“Where is the Wolf Soldier and the white squaw?”
he asked, with characteristic boldness.</p>

<p>They did not know. Some of the Indians were still
out on the prairie, and were riding in.</p>

<p>The scout stayed with the chattering redskins, hearing
their wild talk and speculations; and was amused
by hearing the Cheyenne he had spoken to some time
before make the startling suggestion that the strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
attack had been made by spirits of the Moonlight
Mountains.</p>

<p>Red Wing, who was rather an intelligent Indian,
scoffed at this, but some of the others were ready to
accept the idea. It accounted for the singularity of
the attack, which had begun so strangely and ended as
suddenly and mysteriously as it had begun.</p>

<p>The scout saw some of the absent Cheyennes come
in, and listened to their reports.</p>

<p>They were of a laughable character; for they reported
seeing strange sights and hearing strange
sounds; and one even declared that he had seen a headless
white man galloping round on a gray pony.</p>

<p>As Wild Bill’s pony was gray in color, and he had
stooped low to keep from being seen, Buffalo Bill
understood what gave rise to the Indian’s fancy of a
headless white man on a gray horse.</p>

<p>This report made the more superstitious of the
Cheyennes ready to accept the theory that the wild
attack had been really the work of mischievous spirits
from the near-by mountains.</p>

<p>Some of them looked off in the direction of the
mountains, showing fear of them and a desire to remove
themselves from their vicinity.</p>

<p>Confident that the Cheyennes knew nothing of the
whereabouts of the girl, or of the Wolf Soldier, Buffalo
Bill dropped behind as they moved on in a body,
and succeeded in getting safely out of their dangerous
company. Then he returned quietly toward the point
where he had left Wild Bill.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for a headless horseman!” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
when he rejoined his head. Then he explained, to the
great amusement of his pard.</p>

<p>But Stevens was still missing.</p>

<p>“What next?” asked Wild Bill.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“I’m feeling jubilant, so far as I’m individually
concerned,” Wild Bill admitted, “and you’ll agree that
I’ve a reason; for a little while ago I was a bound
prisoner of those red devils, and they were talking
about the fun they were going to have in torturing me
as soon as they joined their friends. And now I’m
free, with you, old pard; and I’ve got a good revolver,
and a good horse under me. If it was the proper
thing, I think I could do a little yelling, just for purpose
of celebrating the great event.”</p>

<p>But he did nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>Together they began to ride after the moving body
of Cheyennes; and as they rode along, they kept a
sharp lookout for Ben Stevens, and also for the girl,
and Lieutenant Barlow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE THEFT OF THE NUGGETS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Lieutenant Barlow discovered that May Arlington
was not with the Cheyennes, he dropped out
of their midst and began a search for her.</p>

<p>On his part there was no superstitious belief that
the spirits of the Moonlight Mountains had been concerned
in that “attack” on the Indians. He knew he
had heard the yelling of a white man.</p>

<p>Who that white man was he did not know, of
course; but he suspected Buffalo Bill. As for Ben
Stevens, Barlow thought Ben was in prison at Fort
Cimarron.</p>

<p>He had all along believed that Buffalo Bill would
lead a hot pursuit; and he had fancied, too, that the
scout would have at his back a strong body of troopers.
His experience as a soldier had taught him that
the troopers would not delay in following the young
bucks who had broken from their reservation. Hence,
as he set out to look for the missing girl, he had in
mind the possibility of meeting white men; and it was
a possibility which was very disturbing, for he knew
full well that if captured and taken a prisoner back
to the fort he could expect little mercy there.</p>

<p>He had very definite ideas as to what he wished
to do.</p>

<p>First, he must find the girl; for he wished to take
her with him. Her beauty had inflamed his mind, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
he intended to force her to become his wife, in some
remote place to which he would flee when he had secured
the store of gold which he sought. That was,
after all, the chief end&mdash;the securing of that gold.
With it, he would be independent. Without it, he
feared he could do nothing, unless it were to live by
his wits as a card sharper.</p>

<p>Luck seemed to be with him, for he soon came upon
the girl, finding her afoot and alone, bewildered and
frightened in the darkness. She had fallen from
her horse in the stampede, and had run from the noise
of the Indians, thinking safety lay in a direction away
from them.</p>

<p>She ran from him, thinking at first he was an Indian;
and then ran still harder when he called out to
her and she knew who he really was. But he overtook
her very quickly, being on horseback, and drew
rein beside her in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Miss Arlington,” said the renegade, bending from
his horse, and then leaping down beside her, “I have
been looking everywhere for you.”</p>

<p>She drew herself up defiantly, and answered him
with cold scorn.</p>

<p>“Mr. Barlow, I refuse to go with you; I’d rather
fall into the hands of the Indians.”</p>

<p>“That’s foolish,” he said; “I intend to help you.”</p>

<p>“I refuse to go with you!” she repeated desperately,
and she began to run from him.</p>

<p>He followed, calling to her in persuasive tones, and
leading his horse.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was likely thus to lose her in the darkness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
and that his words were without effect, he remounted
and pursued her, and overtook her again
in a short time.</p>

<p>“You are acting silly in this matter,” he asserted.
“Let me help you. Here, you may ride my horse.”</p>

<p>She stopped, in hesitation; for the thought came to
her that she might get on his horse and then make an
attempt to leave him.</p>

<p>But he knew what was in her mind.</p>

<p>“You may ride,” he said, “and I’ll walk. We’ll not
go near the Indians, if you say not to; though, since I
know that young chief, you’re really safer there than
any place else.”</p>

<p>“Who was it made that outcry?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No one knows. Some crazy herder likely. There
are sheep herders down in this section, I’ve heard.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t think that it could have been some
one from the fort?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it could have been,” he said.</p>

<p>She felt helpless and bewildered in the darkness;
and she really feared the Indians. So, after some
further hesitation and questions, with protestations
of good intentions on his part, she mounted to the
saddle he had vacated. But he took care that she
should make no attempt to get away, for he led the
horse by the bit, walking at its head.</p>

<p>He went in the direction of the Cheyennes, while
protesting to her that he meant to do nothing of the
kind, and that as soon as it was light enough to see
he would start with her for the fort.</p>

<p>She did not believe him, but she felt so helpless she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
did not know what to do, and drifted on in this
manner.</p>

<p>Then, almost before she knew it, they were again
in the midst of Red Wing’s band of young Cheyennes,
and she was as much of a prisoner as she had been before.</p>

<p>Wild Bill had disappeared, however, from their
midst, and she hoped he would follow and try to release
her, for she had heard of him, and knew him
to be the friend of any one in distress.</p>

<p>Before day came again, the Cheyennes were in the
midst of the village of their friends, who were Cheyennes
that had fled to this part of the country after
the last Cheyenne war, and had been permitted to remain
there.</p>

<p>As soon as he was safe in this village, Barlow had
the girl placed in one of the lodges, in care of an old
Indian squaw, assuring the girl that it was the best
he could do, and that she would not be harmed there.
Then he began a search for the old medicine man who
was said to have that store of sacred gold nuggets.</p>

<p>He found the medicine man without trouble, for the
old fellow had a lodge of immense size not far from
the heart of the village, where he mumbled his charms
and incantations, and performed the mysterious rites
which awed the Cheyennes and gave him so much
power over them.</p>

<p>Barlow did not get to enter this lodge. The old
man would not permit it, not even when Barlow was
accompanied by Red Wing. Thus the young renegade
got no chance to see the nuggets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span></p>

<p>He knew their story, having overheard it from the
lips of the colonel at the fort, the colonel having received
it from Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>The nuggets were all undoubtedly of Aztec origin;
but how they had come into the hands of this medicine
man was unknown. He had given one of them
to Cody, as a sign of his good will and friendship, at
a time when the scout had brought him out of a fever,
which all his own skill and the skill of the tribe could
not combat.</p>

<p>It was that nugget which the scout had presented to
Colonel Montrose, of Fort Cimarron. The other nuggets
the medicine man sacredly guarded.</p>

<p>The Cheyenne village was thrown into a flutter of
excitement and alarm by the coming of the young
Cheyennes, for it was expected that troopers would
be hot upon their heels.</p>

<p>That night Lieutenant Barlow invaded the lodge
of the medicine man, attacked him, and left him senseless
on the ground, and secured the nuggets.</p>

<p>They were more than twenty in number, and were
contained in two buckskin bags covered with strange
markings and bead work.</p>

<p>The renegade got out of the lodge with the nuggets
without discovery. He next secured a horse, for,
being the “friend” of Red Wing, he was permitted
to come and go freely in the village.</p>

<p>When he had got his horse and secured it beyond
the village lodges, he came back, and called at the
lodge where the girl was held as a prisoner by the
old woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span></p>

<p>The old squaw mumbled unintelligibly, and seemed
about to raise an alarm when he entered, but he gave
her a shining silver piece from his pocket, which she
examined with strange cackles by the light of her
grease lamp.</p>

<p>May Arlington had started up in alarm.</p>

<p>“I have prepared a way of escape,” he whispered
to her. “Come!”</p>

<p>He might have spoken the words aloud, so far as
the old woman was concerned, for the hag knew no
English.</p>

<p>May Arlington again hesitated, then she rose, trembling,
and followed him.</p>

<p>Within the folds of her dress she had secreted a
knife, which she had picked up in the lodge; with it,
if necessary, she would kill Barlow, or herself. But
she knew she must get out of that village. Some looks
given her by certain Indian braves had terrified her
so that anything was preferable to staying there.</p>

<p>Barlow and the girl were hardly beyond the line of
the lodges, when a wild chorus of charging yells and
cheers broke on the air.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill, with Ben Stevens, were
out there, and with them was a body of troopers from
Fort Cimarron. The scouts had found Stevens, and
then had encountered the pursuing troopers, who,
under the leadership of the scouts, had been able to
make so stealthy an advance that this charge on the
Cheyennes was a complete surprise.</p>

<p>Barlow seized May Arlington by the wrist, and
started to run with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span></p>

<p>“Halt!” was the command, for the troopers had
seen him. The light was not good, and so they thought
he was an Indian, who was running to get out of the
village, taking, perhaps, the white girl prisoner who
was known to be there.</p>

<p>Barlow disregarded the command to halt, and ran
to get his horse, dragging the girl with him. She began
to scream, and to try to release herself, but Barlow
clung to her, and to his stolen nuggets.</p>

<p>Another command was bellowed at him, but he still
disregarded it.</p>

<p>There was a flash of fire and the report of a rifle.
The man giving the command to halt had fired.</p>

<p>Barlow fell, pitching forward on his face.</p>

<p>The attack swept through the Cheyenne village like
a whirlwind.</p>

<p>The Indians who sought to fight were pistoled.
Where they made no resistance they were unharmed,
and where they surrendered they were merely made
prisoners.</p>

<p>Red Wing tried to lead a fierce resistance, and fell
at the head of his following.</p>

<p>The other young bucks who had taken so gayly to
the bloody warpath broke and fled, most of them being
captured the next day, while some, resisting,
were killed. Thus the threatened Cheyenne war was
nipped in the bud.</p>

<p>The medicine man, though wounded by Barlow,
escaped otherwise unscathed.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill insisted that the sacred nuggets should
be returned to him; which was done, though some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
of the troopers would have despoiled him if they had
been permitted.</p>

<p>Thus the end came to Lieutenant Barlow, the young
renegade, in the moment when he hoped for the success
of his plans.</p>

<p>The end of the campaign was a quiet wedding, in
the little sod house out on the prairie near Fort Cimarron.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill attended the wedding,
and so did Colonel Montrose, and many of the troopers
from the fort. As a wedding present, the colonel
gave May Arlington the gold nugget which had first
been brought to her in the letter.</p>

<p>No happier bridegroom ever lived than Ben Stevens.
As for Wilkins, the young man who had carried the
letter and had been to some extent the tool of Barlow,
he made a full confession at his trial by court-martial.
He lost his position in the army, but was not
otherwise punished.</p>

<span class="fs70">ALCOHOL AND ELOQUENCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“There were extenuating circumstances for the
young fellow,” remarked Cody to Wild Bill, commenting
on the trial of Wilkins, a few days later. “Chief
of them is his youth. I really felt sorry for him when
he told me about his difficulties.”</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly helped his case as far as possible,”
Wild Bill replied. “It’s a pity we didn’t get
that scoundrel, Barlow, to serve as an example of
military punishment!”</p>

<p>“No use regretting that now; the dog is dead. Well,
for my part, I’m off again.”</p>

<p>“Where do you intend to go now? To Scarlet
Gulch?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I think it’s about time I investigate those
rumors about my crimes, that are floating around in
that section of the country.”</p>

<p>“So do I. If you remember, that’s what I came here
to tell you; but we’ve been busy with other matters.
When will you start?”</p>

<p>“To-day. I’ve said good-by to the colonel. Will
you join me, Hickok?”</p>

<p>“Not just now. I’ve got business to attend to in
Eldorado. I may meet you later, if good luck or adventure
brings us together.”</p>

<p>The two friends parted, soon after this, and went
on their several ways. Buffalo Bill rode slowly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
cautiously across the plains, in the direction of Scarlet
Gulch, thinking over the points which his friend had
given him, and wondering how he should proceed
against the gang of ruffians who were in league against
him, under the leadership of a man known as
“Panther Pete.”</p>

<p>“The first one to tackle is that fellow Slocum,” he
thought. “I suspect he has schemes of his own,
though he appears to be the tool of the others. I’ll
get him first, and I reckon I’ll find him in the Flash
Light Saloon.”</p>

<p>As it happened, this guess was correct. Even then,
while Buffalo Bill was on his track, “Bug-eye” Slocum
was standing in front of Rainey’s saloon in Scarlet
Gulch, talking in a loud voice.</p>

<p>Bug-eye was shabby and disreputable, but he had a
sonorous voice and a way of “slinging words” that
was calculated to make the average citizen of Scarlet
Gulch sit up and take notice.</p>

<p>“Feller citerzens, it’s this here way,” said Bug-eye,
with an oratorical wave of his hand, the other hand
being tucked under and engaged in waving his coat
tails, “when a man who’s been honored as Buffalo Bill
has been honored; when a man who traveled to the
ends o’ the earth and showed benighted lands what
the reel and ginoowine wild West, which we have
here, looks like; when sich a man, I say, stoops so low
as to dishonor hisself by becomin’ an ordinary holdup
thief, a-leadin’ holdup gangs, and so dishonors the
glorious Stars and Stripes that he lives under, and
which gives him perfection&mdash;then I say that it’s time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
fer us, feller citerzens, to put him where the wicked
cease frum troubling and the weary aire at rest.”</p>

<p>Applause greeted Bug-eye’s oratorical effort.</p>

<p>“He’s a-raidin’ ’round through this country,” Bug-eye
went on, tiptoeing to make himself look taller, and
flirting his coat tails until the dust fairly flew from
them, “pertendin’ to be here ter pertect us, and then,
in a sneakin’ way, holdin’ up stagecoaches and lone
and wanderin’ wayfarers, work which he tries ter make
people think is done by the reg’lar road agents. Feller
citerzens, the time is ripe ter put an end to his
masqueradin’, and night roamin’ with a handkerchief
over his face, and elevate him by a rope to a handy tree
limb, and there let him do a dance on nothin’.”</p>

<p>The roaring cheers broke out again.</p>

<p>“And so now I nomernate fer judge of a Judge
Lynch court, that shell do unto Buffalo Bill as he’d
ought to be done to, our esteemed feller citerzen, Nate
Rainey, the keeper of the Flash Light Saloon here&mdash;a
man what sets out the best redeye that’s set out over
any bar in the whole area of this broad and magnificent
country; feller citerzens, I nominates Nate Rainey,
ther man what all of us delights to honor.”</p>

<p>Nate Rainey, a hatchet-faced man, with a billy-goat
tuft of whiskers on the tip of his chin, popped up
like the occupant of a toy jack-in-box. Every one
there was yelling his name, and he flushed with pride.</p>

<p>The scene was the wide piazza in front of the Flash
Light, and the time late afternoon. In the street were
several score men of the border type&mdash;miners, cowboys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
ranchmen&mdash;together with the scum and rabble
always to be found in such a place.</p>

<p>Few of the reputable citizens of the town of Scarlet
Gulch were in that noisy crowd; they had something
more important to do than to hang round Nate Rainey’s
saloon and listen to the big words of Bug-eye
Slocum. But all the dangerous elements of the community
were represented, from the blackleg gambler
to the cheap street loafer.</p>

<p>“I ain’t no orator, like what my friend Slocum is,”
Nate Rainey apologized, as he stood before the yelling
mob, “er I’d try ter make ye a speech. It’s acts
that talks fer me, says I; and so I say, jist bring
Buffler Bill before me, and prove that he’s been doin’
these hyer things that everybody says he’s doin’, and
up he goes, at the end of a rope, quick’s a cat kin wink
her eye; and now you hear me!”</p>

<p>Then everybody yelled, and they yelled again, louder
than ever, when Rainey invited them to step into the
Flash Light and “likker” at his expense.</p>

<p>The situation at Scarlet Gulch, as set forth by Slocum
and Rainey, was singular. For, if credible reports
were to be believed, Buffalo Bill had departed
from his traditional honor, and had not only engaged
in holdups and robbery of various kinds, but had organized
a band of blacklegs and cutthroats, who had
become known popularly as “Buffalo Bill’s Border
Ruffians.”</p>

<p>Who the members of this desperado organization
were no one could say; but it was a fair supposition
that many of them lived in Scarlet Gulch itself, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
probably some of them were in the crowd before the
Flash Light cheering the words of Rainey and Slocum.</p>

<p>As strange as anything in this situation, according
to the reports, was that, when Buffalo Bill first came
into that section, he had come in his customary capacity
as the upholder of law and order. He had been
there but a short time, however, when he was caught
robbing the safe of the First National Bank, which
he blew open with a stick of dynamite, getting all the
money in the cash drawer. He had been seen and
recognized, and after that he had been too wise to
exhibit himself openly in the town; though his Border
Ruffians soon began to make things warm for travelers
on the surrounding trails, and had once ridden
boldly, by night, into Scarlet Gulch, and robbed Payson’s
hardware store, <ins class="corr" id="tn220" title="Transcriber’s Note—“in the very busiest secton” changed to “in the very busiest section”.">in the very busiest section</ins>.</p>

<p>The men who crowded to the bar of the Flash Light
to accept Rainey’s invitation to “likker up” talked of
these things, and threatened what they would do when
Buffalo Bill was caught.</p>

<p>When the drinks had been served, Slocum hopped
to the top of the sloppy bar, posing again oratorically,
with one hand waving and the other under his coat
tails.</p>

<p>“And now, feller citerzens,” he cried, his face beaming
with joy and drink, “we’ll give three cheers for
our esteemed feller citerzen, Nate Rainey&mdash;the man
who is to be Judge Lynch hereafter in this young and
enterprisin’ town, and is ter deal out jestice to all who
deserve it, and give the rope to every man who is doin’
sich things as we know that Buffalo Bill has done.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
And now three cheers fer him, sizzlin’ hot an’ rip-roarin’.”</p>

<p>They gave the three cheers with such will and vim,
and stamped the floor so hard, that several bottles
were shaken from their positions behind the bar and
fell crashing to the floor, the liquor running out.</p>

<p>Bug-eye Slocum looked longingly at that flowing
liquor; but yelled in an abashed voice as he saw two
or three men throw themselves flat down on the floor
and begin to lick it up:</p>

<p>“Sam Wagner there, ain’t you ashamed o’ yerself;
and ain’t you ashamed o’ yerself, Foxfire Bascomb, to
be actin’ in that way, lickin’ likker frum the floor, as
if you was dogs er cats, and the likker was milk?”</p>

<p>“Oh, if they’re so desert dry as that,” said Rainey,
“I’ll set ’em up ag’in.”</p>

<p>He was mightily pleased with the uproarious cheers
which had been given him.</p>

<p>Then there was more drinking, and more talk about
Buffalo Bill’s Border Ruffians.</p>

<p>After that the vigilantes were appointed, a dozen
men, with Rainey as judge; and they were to try Buffalo
Bill as soon as he fell into their hands, and then
hang him.</p>

<p>The “trial” would not be much; for, even before his
capture, Buffalo Bill was thus adjudged guilty, and
sentenced to be hanged.</p>

<p>But Bug-eye Slocum and Nate Rainey had accomplished
their purpose.</p>

<p>This vigilantes band could be used not only against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
Buffalo Bill, but against the enemies of Slocum and
Rainey as well.</p>

<p>Thereafter, if a man gained their ill will, the only
thing necessary to get him out of the way would be
to accuse him of some crime before this court of
Judge Lynch, support the accusation with false testimony,
and forthwith the man would be swung on
high at the end of a rope and promptly choked to
death.</p>

<p>It was almost as quick work as ordinary murder,
and much safer for the murderers; for they could always
show that they were acting for the good of the
community.</p>

<p>When the vigilantes had been chosen, of men selected
beforehand by Slocum and Rainey, there were
again drinks all round; and then the meeting broke
up, and the half drunken and excited crowd flowed out
into the street in front of the Flash Light.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="fs70">A KINDLY WARNING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In spite of his repeated potations, Slocum walked
as straight as he had ever walked in his life, as he
took his way along the street to Hargous’ livery stable,
where he kept a shaggy Indian pony, noted for its
fleetness and untiring endurance.</p>

<p>Bug-eye Slocum had been a cowboy in his younger
days, and he declared that he could not live unless he
stretched his legs over the back of a horse at least
once a day. He nearly always rode forth alone, presumably
for a jaunt over the prairies or through the
near-by hills; where he went he seldom told, and people
did not question.</p>

<p>He rode forth again, as usual, this afternoon, waving
his hand to the people he met in the streets, a hand
waving that had an air of patronage and condescension,
though Bug-eye was half the time in disreputable
rags, and the man patronized thus might have been
dressed in the best of clothing.</p>

<p>As soon as he had left the town behind him Bug-eye
drove the pony into a sharp gallop that carried him
on for a mile or two and sank the town out of sight
behind him. Then he drew rein, and looked carefully
about.</p>

<p>Not observing any one in sight, he wheeled sharply
to the right, rode into a depression that cut through
the level land here, and headed for the hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span></p>

<p>When within the hills and not to be seen by any
one chancing to be out on the prairie, he changed his
course again, and galloped on for a mile or two
farther.</p>

<p>Here, in a depression between the hills, he drew
rein once again, and sat apparently waiting for some
one.</p>

<p>Hoof falls soon sounded, and several horsemen appeared.</p>

<p>The foremost was a tall, handsome-looking man,
wearing a mustache and imperial, his get-up and clothing
causing him to resemble in a remarkable manner
Buffalo Bill. Even the real Buffalo Bill’s closest
friends would have mistaken this rascal for him at a
short distance, and would certainly have made the
mistake at night even, if close by him. Naturally resembling
the great scout in many particulars, he had
by carefully growing a mustache and imperial of the
style worn by Buffalo Bill, and then wearing clothing
of the same pattern, still further heightened the rather
remarkable likeness. But while thus outwardly resembling
the scout, he was otherwise a man of such
different character that he was now playing this
despicable part.</p>

<p>“Hello, Slocum!” he called, with a wave of his
hand; and then he lifted his hat in the Buffalo Bill
manner, with a graceful and gracious bow.</p>

<p>“Does yer ears burn?” asked Slocum.</p>

<p>“Not that I’m knowing to,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Well, ’tain’t true, then, ther sayin’ that if people
is talkin’ about ye, yer ears will burn hot like fire; fer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
yer name has been used most tremendous hard this
afternoon, as I’m knowin’ to, havin’ had a hand somewhat
in usin’ it myself.”</p>

<p>“My name?”</p>

<p>“Well, not yer real name; and come to think of it,
maybe that’s why the thing didn’t make yer ears burn.
They was talkin’ about ther things you’ve been doing,
but ther name used was Buffalo Bill.”</p>

<p>“I am Buffalo Bill!”</p>

<p>“You’re the man they was talkin’ about, anyway.
And I was boostin’ ther thing along.”</p>

<p>He looked hard at the big man, and at the latter’s
followers, who now crowded round him.</p>

<p>“What’s the news, Slocum?” the man asked.</p>

<p>“Well, they’ve organized a vigilantes committee fer
ter hang ye soon’s you put foot in ther town; and
I’ve rid forth ter tell ye about it, so’s you won’t git
caught too easy.”</p>

<p>“To hang me?”</p>

<p>“That’s what ther vigilantes was organized fer, and
they&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you was in it?”</p>

<p>“But I’m explainin’, Panther Pete, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop!” The command was shot out like a bullet
from a gun.</p>

<p>Bug-eye Slocum stopped as suddenly as if he had
been cut down by a rifle bullet.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he gasped, his mouth open, looking
nervously at the chief, who was fingering a revolver.</p>

<p>“It’s that name&mdash;Panther Pete! Use that again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
any time or anywhere, and I’ll pump a bullet straight
through you. You know me&mdash;I’m Buffalo Bill!”</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;yes!” stammered Bug-eye. “I knowed it,
only I forgot.”</p>

<p>“Fergittin’ ain’t healthy where I am, when any
friend o’ mine uses that name. I’ve shed it like a
snake sheds its skin; and I’ve taken on a new skin,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And a rattlesnake’s bite, after it has shed its skin,
is as pizen as before,” said Bug-eye, trying to be
humorous, though his nerves were shaking. “I didn’t
mean no offense, nohow.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t use it ag’in!”</p>

<p>“I won’t; I’ll remember.”</p>

<p>“You bring news of the formation of a vigilantes
committee that’s goin’ to get after me.”</p>

<p>“They only think they aire,” said Bug-eye, waving
his hand impressively, for the oratorical habit was
strong on him. “They think they’re goin’ ter git after
ther fake Buffalo Bill that’s makin’ the trouble in this
section; but I’ve got ther mine laid which will shoot
’em into ther real Buffalo Bill.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Yer see, it’s this way: Ther real Buffalo Bill is
comin’.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? That’s important. When did you hear
it?”</p>

<p>“I heard it last night&mdash;got ther news by grape-vine
telegraph; otherwise, it was brought me secretly by
Jim Welch, ther stage driver. He heard it over near
Fort Cimarron. Seems that Buffalo Bill has got wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
of ther things that’s goin’ on over in this section, and
ther way his name and reppertation is bein’ fly-blown
on, as ye may say, and he’s comin’ over ter see about it.</p>

<p>“I knowed at once that would queer your little game,
Pan&mdash;I mean Buffalo Bill”&mdash;he dodged as if he expected
a bullet&mdash;“and so as soon as ther thing had
been done I hiked out here ter tell ye about it and give
ye warnin’.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see.”</p>

<p>“We’re goin’ ter hang the real Buffalo Bill soon’s
he strikes ther town. Rainey and me got up ther
scheme, and it’s a handsome one, if I do say it; and
it will put William F. Cody nicely under the daisies.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see.”</p>

<p>“And when he’s out o’ ther way, there won’t be so
durned much danger fer fellers like you and me what
has ter make our livin’ by workin’ ther public in one
way and another. But, of course, ther vigilantes, except
two or three more in addition ter me and Rainey,
don’t understand that, and we don’t want ’em to; they
don’t know nothin’ about there bein’ two Buffalo Bills.
And so we’ll bag him as soon as he hits ther town.
And then he dances hornpipes on the thin atmosphere,
and it’s all over with him, and we gits peace out here
fer a while fer men of our stripe. I calls it a handsome
plan, and so does Rainey. And so does Poker
Dan, the gambler. We three really ’riginated and developed
the scheme, and it’s a dandy. We didn’t want
you to walk into the trap, and maybe have ther
vigilantes hang you; and so, as I said, I rid fer this
p’int, with this here warning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span></p>

<p>“I thank you for that, anyway, Slocum. When
will Buffalo Bill be here?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we don’t know,” said Slocum, observing
that Panther Pete’s followers pressed forward to
hear what he said.</p>

<p>“I knew he’d come sooner or later, Bug-eye; this
business was sure to reach him. And I wanted it to.”</p>

<p>Slocum stared.</p>

<p>“For, you see,” Panther Pete went on, “it’s a little
game I’ve been playing here myself, to git him hung.
He put me in jail once, a year ago, and I ain’t forgot
it. When I broke out o’ that jail, I left behind me a
little note fer him, tellin’ him that we’d meet again in
the sweet by and by, and I would settle accounts with
him. Then I planned to play this trick. I thought
it would ruin him in reputation, maybe; and, at any
rate, that when he did arrive here a mob would get
him, fer the crimes I’d been doing.”</p>

<p>He looked hard at Slocum.</p>

<p>“I was on my way to the town. Will it be safe to
go now?”</p>

<p>“I’d advise agin’ it, as I said, and that’s why I’m
here. Keep away frum it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “Work this trick, and hang
Buffalo Bill as soon as he hits Scarlet Gulch. Then
we’ll have a free hand for a while, and I’ll have the
revenge I swore I’d have when I broke out of that
jail. But, just the same, I’m going into the town
to-night. I’ve got a reason which says I’ve got to
go, and I’m going.”</p>

<p>He laughed recklessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span></p>

<p>“Call off your dogs of war, Slocum, while I’m
there; get ’em all to drinking in the Flash Light. You
can get ’em so drunk on Rainey’s pizen that they won’t
know anything until morning. I’ve got a reason to
be in that town, and in I’m going, even if Buffalo Bill
was there himself.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
<span class="fs70">LURED INTO DANGER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It needed no very strong invitation to set the crowd
at Rainey’s to filling themselves full of “pizen.” A
simple hint from Slocum that Rainey was “setting
’em up” was all that was necessary.</p>

<p>Slocum drank with the rest of them; but while the
others were soon half intoxicated, Slocum’s red face,
growing redder and redder, and the strange and shiny
brightness of his prominent eyes, alone indicated that
he had been drinking more than his ordinary amount.</p>

<p>While the loafers and the “bad men” of the town
were thus celebrating at the Flash Light, a handsomely
dressed mounted man appeared in the streets,
accompanied by three others.</p>

<p>The cry went forth that he was Buffalo Bill, but in
reality he was none other than the scoundrel known
to his intimates as Panther Pete.</p>

<p>He had drawn his big hat well down over his eyes,
shading them and the upper part of his face, thus
making it difficult for even one acquainted with him
to say this was not Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>He did not tarry with his men in the principal
street; he had only entered it because he could get into
the town and to the place he was going by that main
street.</p>

<p>Leaving it, he struck off into a side street, and soon
was in front of a small house, that sat at some distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
from other houses. Here he dismounted, swinging
agilely to the ground, and threw his reins to one
of his followers.</p>

<p>“I’ll be out in just a minute,” he said, “and when
I come be ready, for I’m betting that there will be
something doing.”</p>

<p>He ran lightly up the steps of the house, and set his
hand to rap on the door. As he did so the door flew
open, and in the doorway stood a young man, his face
showing an angry flush.</p>

<p>“You’ve come here again, you scoundrel, to see
Ellen West!” said the young man.</p>

<p>Panther Pete dropped a hand to the revolver that
swung at his hip.</p>

<p>“Is it any of your business?” he asked hotly.</p>

<p>“It is. I’m her friend, and I’ve discovered that
you’re a scoundrel, and I came here just now to tell
her so.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t here?” was the cool question.</p>

<p>“No. I came here to see her myself, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tell me where she is, Denton.”</p>

<p>“Go to the devil!”</p>

<p>“Of course, you warned her that I was coming here
this evening, and told her to clear out?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“What have you been saying to her about me?”</p>

<p>“Nothing yet.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t well say to her that I’m what the
drunken fools of this town pretend that I am; for
she knows that Buffalo Bill has always been a man of
honor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span></p>

<p>“I begin to doubt that you are Buffalo Bill,” the
youth declared. “I’ve always heard that he was a
gentleman, and you’re not; and I’ve always heard that
he was an honorable man, and if what I hear now is
true, then you’re the blackest scoundrel that ever
walked the face of the earth.”</p>

<p>“And you would have told her this? You’ve already
talked against me to her?”</p>

<p>Panther Pete’s voice was cool, and even sounded
kindly. Whatever his feelings, he had marvelous control
of them.</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“And why not?”</p>

<p>“Because, you see&mdash;&mdash;” He stopped, hesitating.</p>

<p>“Make it as black against me as you please, but
I’d like to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve delayed, because I was afraid if I said
to her what I think and have heard about you she
might think my words were due to jealousy.”</p>

<p>“Kind of you, I’m sure!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t thank me for it; I’d like to tell her, and
I came here to tell her to-night, and take the chances.”</p>

<p>“Denton, you’re simply crazy jealous. If I take a
notion to a girl, I’ve just as much right to do so as
you have; and to marry her, if I can. You’re in love
with the lady; and so you want to say to me, ‘Hands
off!’ But I don’t have to do what you ask. I’ve come
here to-night to see the young lady, and I know she’ll
be glad to see me. So, if you’ll kindly tell me where
she is, I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Denton flew into a rage and cursed the tall man before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
him, denouncing him with wild anger and opprobrious
epithets. Meanwhile, the men who sat on their
horses not far away squirmed with excitement when
they heard that outburst.</p>

<p>“See here,” said Panther Pete, pushing back his hat,
and showing, as he opened his mouth, cruel white
teeth that gleamed like the teeth of the animal whose
name he bore, “I’ve killed men for less; and I don’t
allow any man to call me such names. So, this&mdash;for
you!”</p>

<p>Panther Pete’s revolver leaped out, there was instantly
a flash and a report, and the reckless young
man pitched forward off the steps, falling prone on the
walk. Panther Pete spurned him with his foot.</p>

<p>“You fool!” he said; “you got what you needed.
Why did you make me do it? I didn’t want to shoot
you, but I can’t stand everything. Well, you’ve got
your medicine, and you won’t trouble me any longer.”</p>

<p>He looked about, and glanced at the house.</p>

<p>Apparently no other person was in the house, for
no one appeared or came forth upon the street to
ascertain the meaning of the shot. That was no doubt
due to the fact that in Scarlet Gulch there was each
night good deal of reckless shooting, which usually
meant no more than that the shooters were drunk.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was apparently unobserved, Panther
Pete walked quickly back to where the men were holding
his horse.</p>

<p>“Now for the other house,” he muttered. “I know
where she is likely to be, even if that fool thought I
didn’t, and wouldn’t tell me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span></p>

<p>When he mounted he said nothing of the man he
had shot, and who lay now sprawled out on the walk
in front of those steps. “Into the other street,” was
his short command, as he took the reins and sprang
tip into the saddle.</p>

<p>They clattered away and were soon in a street
which ran parallel with the one left behind them.</p>

<p>Apparently luck favored Panther Pete, for, as he
rode up in front of a larger house, he saw a young
woman come down the walk and through the gate.
He reined in, and called to her.</p>

<p>“Ellen!”</p>

<p>She had already seen him, though she had not observed
him closely; now she stopped, and then turned
toward him, but hesitated.</p>

<p>“Ellen,” he said, “I’d like to speak with you.”</p>

<p>Ellen West, all unaware that her lover had been shot
down but a few moments before in front of her home
by this man, advanced to where Panther Pete sat on
his horse.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Mr. Cody!” she said, in a tone of
pleased surprise. “I didn’t know you were in the
town.”</p>

<p>“I just came in.”</p>

<p>She glanced about, and at the men who were with
him.</p>

<p>“I can speak safely?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; and glad to hear your voice, no matter what
you say,” was his flattering answer.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re telling awful stories about you, Mr.
Cody; and you’ll not be pleased to hear them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve already heard them,” he said, “and they annoy
me. Your father sent me here to-night.”</p>

<p>“Father sent you?” She had come quite close up
to his horse and now looked up into his face, while he
bent toward her from the saddle.</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard these reports this morning. Your
father was with me at the time; and he told me to
come here at once. You know I’ve advanced him
money to work that mining claim out in the Blue
Hills?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew that,” she said frankly.</p>

<p>“I was out at the claim when the news came to me.
The accusations are against your father as well as
against myself; and the vigilantes that organized to-day
at the Flash Light Saloon intend to hang him, as
well as me, as soon as they can catch us.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re in great danger!” she cried. She was
startled, and her tremulous voice showed that she was
concerned for the safety of her father.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it,” he answered; “but I’ve braved it
to bring this word to you from your father. He wants
you to take one of these horses and ride out with me
to that claim to-night. We’ll be your escort, and you’ll
be perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>“Out to the claim to-night?” She was amazed. It
would be a long and wild night ride.</p>

<p>“That was his request; and I’ve come at his request.
He is to be hung by the vigilantes, if they catch him;
and he fears that they will even treat you harshly, and
so he wanted you to get out of the town at once.”</p>

<p>She hesitated. She did not like the thought of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
long night ride, even though she did not yet distrust
this fake Buffalo Bill, for she believed him to be the
real Buffalo Bill. It seemed strange to her that her
father should ask her to do this thing, for she reasoned
that he ought to know she would not personally be in
any danger in the town.</p>

<p>“I think I ought to see Mr. Denton first,” she said.</p>

<p>Though Panther Pete’s anger flamed at that name,
he still maintained his outward composure.</p>

<p>“I have already met him and sent him out there!”
he said.</p>

<p>“Mr. Denton has gone out there?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he was in as much danger as either your
father or myself, and I told him so. He was riding,
beyond the town, and I urged him to hurry on to the
claim. I told him I’d get you, with this escort, and
see you safe to the claim to-night.”</p>

<p>The thing seemed so impossible to her. She did
not, however, have the least inkling of the truth&mdash;that
this cold-blooded and smooth-tongued villain had
shot Denton but a few minutes before on the very
steps of her own home.</p>

<p>“Come!” said Panther Pete, as she hesitated, “I
can’t stay long. Those vigilantes will know soon that
I’m in the town, if they don’t know it already, and
then I’ll be in peril of having my neck stretched so
long that it would be easy to tie bowknots with it.”</p>

<p>His words were flippant, but his manner was not.</p>

<p>“Oh, is the danger so great as that?” she cried.</p>

<p>“I’ve risked my life to come to you,” he said, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
pretended earnestness. “Please hurry,” he urged;
“for I’m in danger every minute we delay.”</p>

<p>One of his men slipped to the ground.</p>

<p>“We haven’t a sidesaddle to offer you,” said Panther
Pete to her, “but this will do; and you’re a good
rider.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can ride well enough,” she declared. “So
father thinks I ought to ride out to the claim to-night?
It seems strange; and stranger still that Mr.
Denton should ride on in advance. I should have
thought he would wait for me.”</p>

<p>“He had to take a message in a hurry,” lied the pretended
Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” she assented; “just wait for me a minute.”</p>

<p>She ran back into the house, and when she reappeared
a woman came with her.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad to take a ride like that in the night,”
said this woman; “and for my part I don’t think Ellen
is in a bit of danger here. I think she oughtn’t go.”</p>

<p>“But if father says for me to?” she objected.</p>

<p>“He’s scared at nothing, so far as you’re concerned.
There ain’t a soul in this town would hurt you, Ellen.”</p>

<p>“You know what a wild lot some of the men are!”
the girl urged.</p>

<p>“There ain’t one of ’em would say a harmful word
to ye!” the woman protested.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, assisted by the dismounted horseman,
the girl climbed into the big saddle, and then she took
the reins and was ready to ride away.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Mrs. Dean!” she said. “I’ll be back
soon, perhaps to-morrow. This trouble won’t last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
long. I don’t feel that I’d be in danger here, but if
father says for me to come out to him I must do it.”</p>

<p>“You’re a sensible girl and an obedient daughter,”
said Panther Pete, as they moved along the street,
leaving the dismounted man behind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
<span class="fs70">MOBBED AND THREATENED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Panther Pete and his escort, with the girl, were seen
as they galloped out of the town.</p>

<p>A hue and cry was raised immediately, and the
story was circulated that Buffalo Bill and some of his
Border Ruffians had invaded the town and had kidnaped
the beautiful Ellen West.</p>

<p>The young man who had fallen from the steps
under Panther Pete’s pistol fire, and had been left
there by Panther Pete as dead, revived sufficiently to
crawl to the next house, and to raise the alarm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dean, on being interviewed, told her story;
but it did not change the general belief that the girl
had been abducted; it being argued that “Buffalo Bill”
had used persuasions that were false to get her out of
the town, so that in truth it was an abduction.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dean had heard Panther Pete’s declarations
that young Denton had already departed for West’s
mining claim in the Blue Hills; and, of course, this
was seen at once to have been a lie.</p>

<p>Hence, it was believed that the statement that the
girl’s father had asked her to go out there was also
a lie.</p>

<p>A tremendous excitement was created.</p>

<p>The half-drunken men at the Flash Light heard the
news of the abduction, and of the shooting of Denton.
They roared their rage, and the vigilantes rushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
about as if they hoped to capture the man they had
already determined to hang.</p>

<p>While this tremendous excitement was at white
heat, Buffalo Bill rode leisurely into the town.</p>

<p>Riding up to the hitching rail in front of the Flash
Light Saloon, where, as he saw, something exciting
was occurring, he calmly tied his horse, and was on
the point of entering the place when he was seen.</p>

<p>A wild roar of surprise and rage rose. Then a
swarm of men stormed out of the saloon and quickly
surrounded him.</p>

<p>He could not at first understand the nature of their
clamor, but he saw them fingering their weapons, and
saw that their tones and manner were threatening in
the extreme.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, friends?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s you!” was bellowed at him.</p>

<p>“Is that so? Let us go into the Flash Light, where
you may all drink at my expense, and there we will
talk it over.”</p>

<p>“Here come the vigilantes, with Slocum and
Rainey!” some one howled.</p>

<p>Rainey and Slocum had quickly gathered their following,
and were now descending on the scout.
Slocum was in the lead, spectacularly waving his hand,
and Rainey carried a revolver.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” Slocum shouted, almost hysterically.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill looked amazed. “Surrender! Why
should I surrender?”</p>

<p>A roar of wrath went up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span></p>

<p>Slocum planted himself in front of the scout, in an
oratorical attitude. “Because, sir,” he shouted, “you
are a would-be murderer. Not a half an hour ago, sir,
you shot down in cold blood one of our esteemed feller
citerzens, Ben Denton. That he’s livin’ is not your
fault. He got a bullet in his left shoulder, sir, and it
came near wingin’ him on the way to that land where
murderers like you, sir, can never hope to go. That’s
the first indictment we bring against you before the
court of Judge Lynch, sir.</p>

<p>“I am,” he waved his hand, “the prosecuting attorney,
charged by the citerzens of this town with assistin’
the judge in the performance of his duty, and
in the bringin’ to jestice of them that has willfully and
wickedly violated the law.</p>

<p>“My second charge against you, sir, is that you are
the leader of that rascally and villainous organization
of thieves and cutthroats, known hereabouts as Buffalo
Bill’s Border Ruffians; and that as such head of this
villainous organization aforesaid you have been robbin’
stagecoaches and wanderin’ wayfarers on our
highways, and filchin’ the hard earnings of the miners
of this great and growing community, sir.</p>

<p>“In other words, you are Buffalo Bill&mdash;the man who
came to this peaceable section posing as an honest
and honorable man, and then has secretly done deeds
that the light of day shudders, sir, to look at.</p>

<p>“In chargin’ you, sir, with these crimes, I now mention
the runnin’ away a while ago with Miss Ellen
West. And fur these things I ask that the vigilantes,
organized for this purpose, take you, and tie a rope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
round your wu’thless neck, and swing yer wu’thless
carkiss to that tree limb over there; and may God
have mercy on your soul!”</p>

<p>The scout had listened at first in amusement and
amazement. He now saw that there was black meaning
back of all this fustian; that in truth this bombastic
orator represented a committee of vigilantes
determined to take his life. He saw, too, how easy
it was for these men to mistake him for the man who
had been masquerading in his place.</p>

<p>“See here,” said Buffalo Bill, “you are making the
greatest mistake of your life. I have heard of the
rascal for whom you take me, and I agree that if
what has been reported of him is true he deserves
hanging; but I am not that man. I am William F.
Cody, known as Buffalo Bill. There is a man, I am
told, in this section, who has been posing as Buffalo
Bill.”</p>

<p>They interrupted him with howls of anger and
laughter.</p>

<p>He saw now that he would have to fight his way
through that crowd if he hoped to get away, and he
swung with a quick movement into his saddle. But
as he did so, he heard an ominous clicking of revolvers
and saw that more than a dozen were trained on him.</p>

<p>To attempt to break through the crowd, it seemed,
would be simply suicide. He might kill one, or several,
of these men, but they could get him in spite of
that; and then they certainly would make short work
with him at the end of a rope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span></p>

<p>They pushed toward him angrily, and three or four
jumped to get hold of his bridle reins.</p>

<p>“Will you listen to reason?” he said. “I came here
because I had heard of the things done by that masquerader
who was sullying my good name.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t take no bluff like that!” was yelled
at him.</p>

<p>“We know that you’re Buffler Bill, all right,” another
shouted. “And it’s Buffler Bill we’re wantin’.”</p>

<p>Some of them took hold of his legs as if to drag
him out of his saddle.</p>

<p>“You won’t believe that you are making a mistake?”</p>

<p>“Hang him!” roared the mob.</p>

<p>Some one flourished a rope suggestively, while the
crowd surged round, roaring and shouting.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill now drew a revolver. He did not intend
to be hanged by this mob. If his life was to be
lost he would lose it fighting, not at the end of a rope.</p>

<p>Suddenly he drove his spurs desperately into the
flanks of his horse, having before that, by a slash of
his knife, released it from the hitching rack. It made
one jump, then a revolver cracked, and the horse fell
sprawling, a bullet in its brain.</p>

<p>The scout would have been hurled violently to the
ground if he had not disengaged his feet from the stirrups
and landed in an upright position.</p>

<p>As he struck the ground he held a revolver in each
hand, and he was ready to use them.</p>

<p>He felt that his last hour had probably come, but
he meant to meet it like a hero; these men would not
have it to say afterward that he had gone to the rope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
like a cringing coward. And if he had to die, he
would take dear toll to pay to the grim ferryman.</p>

<p>But before he could use his revolvers there was a
shout in the street, a loud clatter of galloping hoofs,
and a man came dashing up into the very fringe of
the howling mob.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE WESTERN DEAD SHOT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The man who had galloped with that yell right into
the crowd was none other than Wild Bill, the Western
dead shot.</p>

<p>Many of the men there recognized him, and they
were sure his sudden dash meant an attempt to rescue
Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>Wild Bill reined in his horse so quickly that he
threw it back on its haunches. It reared, its pawing
front feet making the men there scatter, and when
it came down, Wild Bill, with a touch of the spur,
drove it to Cody’s side. Then he half wheeled his
horse, lifting his cap to the astonished crowd.</p>

<p>“It seems to me, from the look of things, that
you’ve got the wrong steer by the horns! I know that
my friend Cody is too white a man to ever do anything
that would call for a hanging bee.” He smiled upon
Buffalo Bill. “Eh, pard, what have they got it in for
you for?”</p>

<p>Not a man there but had heard of Wild Bill, and
many of them knew him by sight; so that when it was
known that this was Wild Bill, the most dare-devil and
reckless shot of the West, the man who feared not the
face of clay, and if report spoke correctly would rather
shoot than eat, there was a falling back. Yet they still
surrounded Buffalo Bill and this new rider, and
seemed no more disposed to give up their prey than
if they were a band of wolves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span></p>

<p>Wild Bill had seen many mobs, and he knew their
moods and methods; yet his flashing eyes betrayed no
sign that he really understood the very dangerous and
ticklish position which he and his noted pard were in.
He even seemed to be merry.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he said, “won’t some one enlighten
me? Here am I, a wayfarer, blundering into this
tragic scene, but knowing no more what it is about
than if I were the off hind wheel of a prairie schooner.
I can see, though, that you are harboring some sort of
hard feelings against my friend Cody, as white and
true a man as ever breathed the breath of life. What
is it? Spit it out!”</p>

<p>They began to “spit it out,” telling him the things
with which Buffalo Bill stood charged.</p>

<p>“And he denies it? Strange that he should deny
anything like that! I’m afraid, though, that I’ll have
to help him deny it. For I know that there is another
man who goes round here pretending to be my pard
Cody. I got word of it, not long ago, over in the
Bitterroot country, and I’ve ridden over here to hunt
the devil down, just for my pard’s sake.”</p>

<p>The great scout gave him a look of gratitude.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that Cody was here, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s jist it!” was yelled at him. “You didn’t
think that Buffler Bill would do the things that it’s
known he’s done. Nor we didn’t think it, till we had
the proofs and had to. And here, when you come, you
find him, caught for doin’ the things you wouldn’t believed
of him. And now that we’ve got him we’re
goin’ ter make him dance on air.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span></p>

<p>Again that roar of rage broke forth from the surging
and excited mob. The whisky these men had
swallowed in the Flash Light had helped to transform
them into human wolves.</p>

<p>For a few moments after Wild Bill had thus tried
to interfere they had held back. They were astonished
by his boldness and they feared his deadly revolvers;
but they did not intend to be balked of their feast of
blood. They intended to have the life of Buffalo Bill;
<ins class="corr" id="tn247" title="Transcriber’s Note—“and if Wild Bill interefered” changed to “and if Wild Bill interfered”.">and if Wild Bill interfered</ins>
and stood in the way, then so much the worse for him, for they would
promptly hang him, too, for being a meddler and an obstructer of
border justice.</p>

<p>Both Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill understood what
was seething in their minds; and, if they had not so
understood, the cries that now went up would have
quickly informed them.</p>

<p>“Stand outer the way, thar, Wild Bill!” a man
yelled. “We ain’t got no fight against you; but t’other
feller we’re after, and aire goin’ to have.”</p>

<p>Slocum stood on the outskirts of the crowd, trying
to make his voice heard in the uproar. Close by him
stood Rainey, revolver ready for bloody work.</p>

<p>Half of the crowd had revolvers out, and in their
drunken condition they were ready to shoot.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill spoke again, repeating his story and
his denials.</p>

<p>“Hang ’em both!” was roared. The crowd surged
forward. The rope was flourished by the ruffian who
parried it, and from some other point a cowboy’s lasso<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
was hurled forward, for the second noose intended
for the neck of Wild Bill.</p>

<p>The dead shot crowded his horse close against the
scout, who, since the death of his own animal, was
afoot.</p>

<p>“Up behind me, pard!” he said, stooping over so
that Buffalo Bill could hear him. “We’ll make a break
together, and go down together, fighting. I think
I’m good for a half dozen of these wolves before they
get me, and you’re good for as many more. There
will be something occurring in the graveyard business
here to-morrow, anyway.”</p>

<p>His eyes flashed fire, and his voice was tense with
determination.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill saw that delay only increased the danger.
Soon those nooses would be round his own neck
and the neck of his friend; and when that happened
the end was not far off.</p>

<p>“All right!” he cried.</p>

<p>Wild Bill swung the horse around as Buffalo Bill
sprang for its back. As he did so, his gold-mounted
revolver glittered in the light of the Flash Light’s
lamps.</p>

<p>The time for desperate action on the part of the
two pards had come. What the end would be they
did not know, but they were prepared to die fighting.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE MAN WHO INTERFERED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In an upper room of the boarding house that occupied
the story above the Flash Light Saloon a man sat
at an open window, looking down on the exciting
scenes described.</p>

<p>He had taken that room the day before, had haunted
the bar of the Flash Light a good deal since that time,
and hinted that he was the wonderful inventor of
something that would produce rain. He had not
touched much liquor, due doubtless to the fact that his
finances were obviously at a low ebb. At least, this
was the opinion of Rainey, who sized up the financial
ability of every man who came his way.</p>

<p>Rainey had paid little attention to this man, who
had signed his name on the boarding-house register as
Silas Deland.</p>

<p>Silas Deland had been sitting by that upper window
when Buffalo Bill rode up in front of the Flash Light
and had been surrounded by the mob, and he had continued
to sit there until after the appearance of Wild
Bill. He seemed deeply interested in what was occurring,
and leaned now and then from the window.
After a while he produced a revolver.</p>

<p>Finally he went to the “grip” from which he had
taken some cartridges for the revolver, and dug out
of it a round object of the size and shape of an egg.</p>

<p>With this in his hand, Silas Deland returned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
his post by the window, and again looked down on
the mob that surrounded the two prairie pards.</p>

<p>Once or twice he lifted the hand which held the
egg-shaped object, as if he meant to hurl it into the
midst of that screaming crowd. But he hesitated, and
continued to watch and listen until he saw Wild Bill
draw his horse around and Buffalo Bill leap to mount
behind him. Then the man’s hand went up again, and
the white, egg-shaped object shot through the window.</p>

<p>There followed a quick exploding puff at the point
where it struck the ground, and out of that exploding
puff shot a very rain of fire and smoke. Instantly the
street was obscured by the smoke and fire, and the
members of the mob fell back, thinking that a bomb
had burst in their midst.</p>

<p>There was a quick leap of Wild Bill’s horse, and,
as it sprang away through the smoke, two men were
mounted on it, and they were the prairie pards.</p>

<p>“Hang tight!” Wild Bill had said, as he drove the
spurs deep and the horse made its first wild jump.</p>

<p>It was out in the street and away from the Flash
Light Saloon so quickly that the mob did not know
it. In fact, the men there were paralyzed for the moment
by the strange explosion. They had rushed pell-mell,
trampling and pushing, and even treading each
other down.</p>

<p>At the window above, all unsuspected, sat the
strange man of the red face and fiery nose; and he
chuckled audibly when he saw the panic his little bomb
had created.</p>

<p>The two border pards were in the main street, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Wild Bill’s fast horse, and were getting out of Scarlet
Gulch at almost railroad speed.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” cackled the man at the window, as he
saw them go. “See what a great splutteration a little
smoke and fire kindleth!” He peered down into the
street.</p>

<p>“To see the combobberation that thing kicked up
one would think that a dozen men are lying dead down
there! Yet I’ll bet, unless some of ’em got burned
a bit by the fire, not a single man Jack of ’em is hurt
in the least.”</p>

<p>It was true, as the members of the mob were already
beginning to discover. If the thing that had exploded
in their midst had been a bomb of deadly character, it
had not harmed a man. As soon as they saw that,
their shattered courage began to return.</p>

<p>Rainey and Bug-eye Slocum began to roar their
wrath again, and to shout commands to their followers.</p>

<p>“Foller ’em!” yelled Rainey.</p>

<p>“Those bomb-hurling miscreants, who had imported
the methods of Russia into this land of the free and
home of the brave, must be captured at once,”
screeched Slocum, oratorical even in his rage. “What,
ho!” he yelled. “A hundred simoleons to the man
what brings either one of ’em back, dead or alive!”</p>

<p>No one was heartless enough at the moment&mdash;or
thought enough, perhaps it ought to be said&mdash;to ask
Bug-eye where he expected to get the hundred dollars
he offered so freely, for not once in a decade was he
known to have so much money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span></p>

<p>No one stopped to question. They were furious as
baffled foxhounds, and all were yelping, to the effect
that the escaping men must be pursued and brought
back, and hung for this outrage.</p>

<p>The man at the window above looked down and
chuckled, and then laughed and chuckled again, rubbing
his hands together in a sort of delirious glee.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” he said. “They think the bomb was
hurled by one of the prairie pards. Well, it’s natural
that they should! They’d never suspect poor old Silas
Deland up here of doing a thing like that. Poor old
Silas is too simple-minded and altogether too innocent
an old whisky tub to even think of doing a thing like
that. Ho, ho! Hear the heathen rage and imagine
vain things. It’s fun to the man up the tree.”</p>

<p>A pursuit was begun in hot haste, the members of
the mob seizing whatever horses they could lay their
hands on. But with the scouts already out of the
town, and the darkness heavy beyond the circle of the
street lamps, it seemed unlikely that any pursuit could
be effectual.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />
<span class="fs70">DENTON AND DELAND.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There was one man in Scarlet Gulch who, if he had
had any doubt of the masquerading of Buffalo Bill’s
double, had that doubt completely blown to the wind
by what he witnessed in the street before the Flash
Light Saloon. That man was young Ben Denton, the
lover of Ellen West.</p>

<p>He was far from dead; though wounded in the
shoulder, and by the shock of the bullet and his heavy
fall rendered temporarily unconscious.</p>

<p>On recovering consciousness, he discovered quickly
that Ellen West had been induced to leave the town
with the man who had shot him, and he knew she was
unaware of that shooting, and had gone with the man
in full faith of his sincerity and good intentions.</p>

<p>Having crawled to his feet, and then received aid
from friendly hands, who bandaged his shoulder and
gave him stimulants, the young fellow’s courage gave
him strength to get down into the street before the
Flash Light Saloon, where, he heard, Buffalo Bill had
been captured and was about to be hanged. He heard
the scout’s explanation and declarations of what had
taken place, and he was sensible enough to see that this
man was really the great scout, of whom he had so
often heard, but up to that moment had not beheld.
He saw how he and the girl, and all their friends, had
been fooled by the man who had been so boldly masquerading
as Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span></p>

<p>Denton was in that wild throng when Wild Bill
made his appearance, and he was still there when Silas
Deland hurled the smoke-and-fire bomb into the
crowd, with such spectacular effect.</p>

<p>He saw the escape from the mob of the real Buffalo
Bill, on the back of Wild Bill’s horse, and accompanied
by that redoubtable fighter. Still lingering and weak,
he heard the angry shouting and denunciations, and
the wordy commands of Slocum and Rainey, and saw
the hasty attempt being made to follow the fleeing
men.</p>

<p>Then he still further gathered together his strength
and his courage, and, getting a horse from a stable
near, he mounted, white-faced and panting, but courageous
and undaunted, and rode out of the town himself,
intending to be close to the mob of pursuers.</p>

<p>The drunken mob scattered as they left the town
behind, some falling out and returning almost at once,
others continuing on. But though Slocum and Rainey
led, the pursuit was but a disorganized and disorderly
thing, and showed little capability.</p>

<p>“They’ll never do anything,” said Denton.</p>

<p>He turned from the racing and drunken pursuers,
and rode away alone, shaping his course in the direction
he believed the false Buffalo Bill had taken.</p>

<p>He had gone but a little way in this manner when
he heard galloping hoofs. Some one else was heading
in the same course.</p>

<p>A mounted form loomed up out of the darkness,
and this mounted form drew rein.</p>

<p>“What, ho!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span></p>

<p>“Who’s there?” said Denton, clutching the revolver
he had armed himself with before starting.</p>

<p>“Are you Ben Denton?”</p>

<p>Ben did not recognize the voice, and to be thus addressed
rather astonished him.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is my name,” he answered.</p>

<p>The horseman rode near; then he saw before him a
man he had once noticed in the Flash Light Saloon,
a man whose face and nose were very red as if from
much drinking.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” cackled this man. “This is hard riding!
I’ve been follerin’ ye fer nigh about an hour, seems to
me.”</p>

<p>“What for?” Denton asked suspiciously, and
sharply.</p>

<p>“Because of what I know about ye, and what I
heard about ye. You’re interested in the rescue of
the young lady that has been run away with by an
imp o’ Satan who has been goin’ round playin’ a ruffianly
Buffalo Bill?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Denton was puzzled. How did this man
know so much?</p>

<p>“Well, I’m Sile Deland. I’ve been puttin’ up at
the boardin’ house over the Flash Light. I was gittin’
a horse fer myself when I seen you git that’n and
cut out. And I follered ye.”</p>

<p>“What for?” Denton wondered if this man was
to be trusted. He knew nothing about him.</p>

<p>“Because I’m a human bein’, and so am naturally int’rested
in the capture of the same man that you aire;
and I didn’t know but that we could hunt together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
like a pair o’ wolves, say; and maybe I could help you,
and you could help me.”</p>

<p>“You know something about that man?” Denton
asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t, but I know he’s a rascal. My name’s Silas
Deland.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know you,” the young man protested.
“What do you want to capture that man for?”</p>

<p>“Same as you do&mdash;to see that he gits what’s properly
deservin’. Shall we two jog along together, er do
we sep’rate right here? Maybe I could help ye. I
was told you’d been shot; and when I seen ye go, I recognized
the fact that you wasn’t fit, and was takin’
some mighty big resks.”</p>

<p>Denton, who had been holding on by sheer strength,
felt a sudden weakness, which he conquered.</p>

<p>“I think I’d prefer to go on alone, unless you can
tell me just where I can find that man, and who he is.”</p>

<p>“If I knew where to find him, I’d be happier than
a fool; but I don’t know. As to who he is, I don’t
mind in tellin’ you that among them that knows him
best he’s called Panther Pete. So I’ve been told.”</p>

<p>“Panther Pete!”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho! I see you’ve heerd that name?”</p>

<p>“The name of the leader of the Black Bandits!”</p>

<p>“Jest the same feller. He cut up sich blood-and-thunder
shines over in the Bittersweet country that
he had to light out of there. Buffalo Bill was after
him hard at the time. He disappeared, dropped out
of sight, and then reappeared here, callin’ himself Buffalo
Bill, and doin’ ther things you’ve heard hereabout.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
Well, that’s him, Panther Pete&mdash;the blackest, meanest,
most contemptible villain that walks under the sky.
He was down in Arizony onct, when I was there, and
so I know that much about him.”</p>

<p>“You’re after him? Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Me?” he cackled again. “Call me Sile Deland, and
you’ll hit it. I’m after him only because I think he
ought to be punished, and I like the excitement of a
man hunt. Shall we strike hands together as pards,
and make this hunt in pair?”</p>

<p>The young man hesitated. “I think I’ll go alone,”
he said finally. “Thanks for your kind offer; and because
I don’t accept, don’t think I don’t appreciate
it. But&mdash;I don’t know you; and I’ve found out that
when out here you don’t know a man it’s safe to let
him alone.”</p>

<p>“You’re cautious, and caution usually wins, young
man. I don’t blame ye. So long!”</p>

<p>When young Denton went on again, Deland held in
his horse until the young man had passed on. Then
he gave his horse its head and permitted it to follow
in the same general direction, drawing rein now and
then to listen to the clattering feet of Denton’s pony.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was confusion in those clattering
hoofs.</p>

<p>“Ah! I expected it.”</p>

<p>Silas Deland rode forward finally, and soon he came
on a sight that startled him. Young Denton, overcome
by weakness and loss of blood, had tumbled
blindly from his saddle. One foot clung to the stirrup,
and his horse was dragging him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span></p>

<p>Silas Deland yelled to the horse, rode up to it,
leaped to the ground, and stopped it; and then, disengaging
the young man’s foot, he laid the unconscious
youth down on the grass, and began to work to restore
him to consciousness.</p>

<p>“It’s what I looked for, young man! Your courage
is bigger than any other part of you&mdash;bigger even
than your common sense, or you’d never tried this
thing in the condition you’re in. It’s a good thing
for you that I tried to keep close to you. You, and
that young lady, too, seem to be needin’ help about
this time.”</p>

<p>He drew a metal whisky flask from his pocket and
poured some of the whisky down Denton’s throat.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! You ain’t dead, ’tany rate! You’re
comin’ round. Nothing like this here wine of life to
put a man’s breathin’ apparatus to work when it’s gone
on a sudden strike. Fer myself, though, I never
teches it, unless I’m snake bit, er dyin’; and I only
prescribes it in oncommon needy cases, like this here.
You’re comin’ round! Well, now, mebbe, you’ll have
more respect for yer humble servant. And we’ll go
huntin’ that girl together, so we will.”</p>

<p>He gave Denton some more of the powerful stimulant,
and was pleased by his signs of returning animation.</p>

<p>When Denton opened his eyes to consciousness
again, the first thing he was aware of was that the
queer stranger was sitting before him in the darkness,
chuckling like some strange animal, and offering
him a drink of whisky out of a metal bottle.</p>

<span class="fs70">IN A WEB OF LIES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Ellen West rode forth from Scarlet Gulch in doubt,
with Panther Pete, believing him to be Buffalo Bill,
a man she felt she ought to honor, yet troubled by unpleasant
forebodings.</p>

<p>He had told her that her father, who was working a
claim in the Blue Hills, some distance away, wished
her to come there, and had sent him to escort her.</p>

<p>When they were beyond the town, he said:</p>

<p>“Miss West, I didn’t want to tell you, but your
father is not well.”</p>

<p>“Not well?” she said, alarmed. “You mean he is
very sick, dying perhaps?”</p>

<p>“The fact is,” he exclaimed, “he fell and hurt himself
in that tunnel he is digging; some rock fell on
him, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is dying! I know it. Why didn’t you tell
me at once?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to scare you,” he answered.</p>

<p>“He is dying?”</p>

<p>“No, not so bad as that; but he is hurt, and I
thought you ought to be out there. Girls are scared
of the dark, you know, and so&mdash;well, I done the best
I could. I didn’t want to make you feel bad, either;
but I reckon the time for you to know it has come.”</p>

<p>She asked him again and again why he had not
told her at first of the injury to her father, and urged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
him to give details; until, in replying to her, he had
constructed such a piece of fiction that he felt rather
proud of it and his abilities in that line.</p>

<p>Two or three miles from the town he was joined
by half a dozen rough-looking riders, who peered at
the girl from under their slouched hats in a way to
make her uneasy. These wild figures fell in behind
her and the supposed Buffalo Bill, as if they were the
escort.</p>

<p>“Friends of mine,” said Panther Pete. “Some of
the members of my band of scouts.”</p>

<p>“Oh, your scouts!” she said, much relieved.</p>

<p>“I’m the chief of the scouts, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard that. And these are some of
them?”</p>

<p>She glanced at the sky. Being a prairie girl, she
knew the stars by sight, and was able to tell which was
north as well as any one. She saw the Big Dipper,
with its two outer stars pointing to the north star.
She had observed that a change had been made in
their course, and she saw that a further change of
course occurred now, a change that surprised her, for
she knew it was not the right direction to take her to
her father’s claim. She spoke of it to the man who
rode beside her.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, right ye are! But, you see, it’s this way:
There’s danger now in going the straight course, and
so we make this circle. We’ll be steering in the other
direction soon.”</p>

<p>“What is the danger?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Outlaws,” he said gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span></p>

<p>“Outlaws?”</p>

<p>“You’ve heard of the stage holdups? Well, it’s the
fellows who have been doing that work. These men
here saw them over in that direction this afternoon,
and so we’re trying to get round them. I didn’t want
to worry you by mentioning it.”</p>

<p>This satisfied her for a time, but when, in the
course of two or three hours of brisk riding, they
passed through a deep cañon pass and came to a hollow
in the hills, at a point which she was sure was a
long way from her father’s mining claim, and there
saw some log huts of poor construction, and the party
was challenged by a guard, her fears sprang up.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“We’re going to get a stronger force here,” said
Panther Pete, still thinking that lying would serve
him best. “We need a large escort.”</p>

<p>Again she was silent, and they passed into the valley.</p>

<p>Some dogs barked loudly, but were driven back to
their kennels; and then she was before one of the
huts, and was told to dismount.</p>

<p>Panther Pete swung down and helped her from the
saddle.</p>

<p>“We’ll rest a little while,” he explained. “Then
we’ll go on again.”</p>

<p>“But we ought to hurry right on, for father may
be dying,” she protested.</p>

<p>“We’ll need a little rest,” he urged, and he opened
the door of the hut and showed her within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span></p>

<p>She stood in the darkness, inside, hesitating, for
she began to feel that something was wrong.</p>

<p>Panther Pete followed her into the hut, and then
lighted a lamp, which stood on a low table at the opposite
side of the room. By its lights she saw that the
hut contained but one room.</p>

<p>“Just stay here and rest a minute,” he urged, “and
I’ll be right back. I’ll have something brought for you
to eat, and then in a little while we’ll go on again.”</p>

<p>However, when he retreated and closed the door,
she distinctly heard the key turned in the lock.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cody,” she called after him, still hearing his
retreating footsteps. “Mr. Cody!”</p>

<p>She shook the door, and then pounded on it with
her closed fist, and called again; but he did not answer,
and he did not turn back. Bewildered now, and
badly frightened, she shook the door again and again,
and raised her voice in loud calls.</p>

<p>One of the dogs set up a barking outcry, hearing
her, but no human being responded.</p>

<p>There was no window in the hut, but near the roof
were some small holes that let in light and air. She
could not climb up to those holes, and it would not
have helped her if she could have done so. In despair,
she glanced round the room.</p>

<p>It contained a rude bed, some chairs, and a table
and lamp, and nothing else. The floor was of earth,
beaten hard.</p>

<p>She sat down to await the return of the man who
had locked her in. By and by she heard him coming,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
and she heard the key turn in the lock when he opened
the door.</p>

<p>She was on her feet, facing him, as he entered.</p>

<p>“I must ask you to explain this&mdash;this&mdash;&mdash;” She
panted and hesitated for words.</p>

<p>He closed the door quickly, and stopped in front
of it.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he said.</p>

<p>“Why, you locked me in when you went away!
Why did you do that?”</p>

<p>“For your protection,” he said, still thinking it best
to lie to her.</p>

<p>“For my protection?”</p>

<p>“Yes; some of these men here I don’t trust. They’re
all right as scouts, and all that, but I don’t trust them.
We’ve got to stay here a little while, until we can get
more men; for the outlaws, it’s reported, are in strong
force between here and the Blue Hills.”</p>

<p>His manner had changed, and the truth suddenly
came to her, with its startling revelation.</p>

<p>“You are not Buffalo Bill!” she cried, gasping.</p>

<p>“Who’s been telling you I’m not?” he said, startled.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know it! I feel it! You can’t be Buffalo
Bill. I did hear rumors, and thought them&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What rumors?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“That Buffalo Bill was not in this part of the country,
and that you were a fake Buffalo Bill. But I
didn’t believe them, for you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“For I was making love to you and all that?” He
laughed harshly.</p>

<p>“No; because you were father’s friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been good to him, for your sake,” he
said brazenly.</p>

<p>She became terrified, for this seemed almost a confession
that he was not Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>“I’ve been good to him,” he repeated, “and he knows
it, and he don’t doubt that I’m Buffalo Bill. I let
him have a thousand dollars to help him out with that
claim, and he doesn’t forget it.”</p>

<p>She regarded him with terror, for there was a
change in his manner&mdash;a reckless change apparently.</p>

<p>“You will take me on to father’s claim as soon as
possible?” she said.</p>

<p>He dropped to a rough stool close by the door, in
such a manner that the door was still guarded by his
body.</p>

<p>“Well, what if I’m not Buffalo Bill, as you say?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I am afraid you’re not.”</p>

<p>“And if I ain’t?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“You have told me you were!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“And you’ve said I wasn’t. Well, I ain’t.”</p>

<p>He paused to note the effect of his words. She
withdrew toward the other side of the room, alarm
and fright showing in her face and manner.</p>

<p>“I’m not Buffalo Bill, though I reckon as that ain’t
the name that his mother gave him I’ve as much right
to it as he has. In other words, I’m not Bill Cody.
And I reckon, too, that you’ve heard of me; most
people round here have. Do you want to know who
I am? I’m Panther Pete.”</p>

<p>She screamed, and crowded closer against the wall
when she heard that dreaded name. Panther Pete!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
It was a name of infamy, a name that reeked with
blood, a name to blanch the cheek of woman or man;
for the miscreant who bore it was notorious as a murderer
and outlaw, with innumerable black and bloody
crimes laid at his door.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard of me, I see,” he remarked, with a
sardonic smile.</p>

<p>She did not answer, but stared at him, large-eyed
and fearful.</p>

<p>“And now that you know who I am, what do ye say
to it? Ain’t I as good-looking as I was before&mdash;as I
was when you thought me Buffalo Bill? Buffalo Bill!
Faugh! He’s a milksop, that tries to make people
believe that kindness pays when you’re dealing with
Indians and cattle like that; and then has to go out
and shoot up them same Indians for their deviltry, and
thus eat his own words. It ain’t been any special
honor to me to play Buffalo Bill; but I had a reason
for doing it, which was to get him in a sling. I
think he’s in that sling about now, and he won’t get
out of it easy.”</p>

<p>It was a long speech, but he seemed to enjoy his
words, and the terror they brought to the countenance
of the girl.</p>

<p>“Please&mdash;please take me to my father!” she begged.</p>

<p>He laughed again harshly.</p>

<p>“You believed that part of it, too, did ye?”</p>

<p>“Please take me to my father!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a thing I ain’t thinking of doing. I
couldn’t afford to deprive myself of your charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
presence, ye know. I’ve taken a fancy to you. My
dear, I’m dead in love with you.”</p>

<p>She wanted to scream again.</p>

<p>“You know I told you that once, at your home over
there in Scarlet Gulch,” he continued calmly. “You
thought I was Buffalo Bill, and you smiled when I said
it. I’m the same man, and when I say it now you
show a weak disposition and a tendency to holler,
which is unkind of you.”</p>

<p>She turned on him in wild desperation. “You
must let me out of this house!” she cried. “I won’t
stay here. You promised to take me to my father,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Promises made to a handsome woman are like the
proverbial pie crust, made to be broken. I wanted to
bring you here.”</p>

<p>“And lied to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I lied to you like a sinner. I might as well
admit it. I ought to have told you the truth at first;
only I thought you’d yell, and there would be a sweet
muss of it in the street, maybe with a lot of fellows
chasin’ me and trying to shoot me full of holes. So
I lied to you.”</p>

<p>“And my father?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t seen your father for a good while. That
was a lie, too. I think he’s well and healthy. I don’t
expect to see him again soon.”</p>

<p>“And you intend&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just to keep you here a while, my dear, out of
affection for you, pure and simple; and then, as soon
as it’s safe, we’ll hike out for a preacher I know about,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
who’ll marry us. He ain’t in good standing in the
church just now, but he can tie the matrimonial knot
as tight for us as the next one, and that’s what we
want. You see, he got into trouble at the last church
he presided over, and, when some of the deacons and
leading members wanted to put him in jail, he just
jumped the country and came to me; and I’ve treated
him better than ever they did, and he’s makin’ more
money.”</p>

<p>“He is a member of your band of road agents?” she
cried.</p>

<p>“I don’t call ’em that; they’re gentlemen of the
road, doing good to the world by taking money from
rich folks who don’t need it and handing it over to
poor folks that do, with just a little for themselves by
way of toll for the trouble. And yet people say hard
things against us, and invite us to necktie parties and
all that. It’s unjust and unreasonable.”</p>

<p>Ellen West had never before seen the devil displayed
in human form as she now saw it in this smiling,
handsome fellow, who said these things as coolly
as if they were but jest, and sat there, his white teeth
showing as he laughed. He looked to be a fiend incarnate.</p>

<p>Realizing just what he was, and all the horror of
her own position, she wanted to shriek. Then she began
to beg him again to let her go; and he answered
in the same way, laughing at her words, and making
light of her fears.</p>

<p>“Miss West,” he said, “you’ll find us just the finest
lot you ever met. So don’t be afraid and go off into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
a fit. I’m going to make you my wife. I’ve sworn to
have the life of Buffalo Bill. I planned a little trick
that I think will get him as soon as he puts his nose
into Scarlet Gulch. If it doesn’t, I’ve got some other
plans that will. I intend to do him up, for some things
I owe him.</p>

<p>“That will, of course, necessitate my sudden retirement
from this section. I shall emigrate, get out of
the country, and go in search of pastures new. And
I know where those pastures are&mdash;green, and flowing
with gold dollars and milk and honey.</p>

<p>“I want somebody to go with me for company, and
I’ve hit on you as the female angel that will soothe
and console me in that time of retreat and trial. I’ve
got a snug abode just built for two up in the mountains,
and we’ll bill and coo there like a pair of turtle
doves, and forget those awful times down here.”</p>

<p>He sat before her, his elbows on his knees, his hands
supporting his chin, and looked at her; and she stared
at him, as the charmed bird is said to stare helplessly
at the serpent.</p>

<p>She saw how helpless she was in the power of this
man. About her were the plains and the rolling hills,
and darkness and distance. She did not even know
where this hut and this valley were situated; nor how
far she had come after leaving Scarlet Gulch. But
she knew that in this valley were the road agents who
acknowledged the authority of this man&mdash;Panther
Pete. Yes, she was helpless, and she realized it.</p>

<p>“Oh, let me go!” she begged in terror, throwing
herself on her knees before him. “Please&mdash;please let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
me go! I shall pray for you every day of my life,
if you will let me go. I once considered you an honorable
man, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He put out his hand and touched her head, causing
her to shiver.</p>

<p>“My dear girl, have a little sense!” he said. “Is
it such a terrible thing to think of marrying me? I’ll
bet that, when you thought I was Buffalo Bill, you
were of the opinion that I was rather a stunning fellow
in general appearance! Now, didn’t you? And
I’m as good-looking now as then. Come, be sensible!
I’m not going to scalp you, or feed you to my dogs
out there. In fact, I’m not going to hurt you at all.
I’m simply going to hold you until you’re willing to
go before our parson and marry me. Think what that
will mean! You will be the wife of Panther Pete, and
queen of the road agents! Doesn’t the prospect allure
you? If it doesn’t, it ought to. To be queen of our
road agents isn’t so small a matter as you may think
it. They’re a jolly lot, and fighters every one, from
the ground up. There are worse jobs than being
queen to a set of fellows like that. Why, if you
should be kind to ’em, and say a good word now and
then to ’em, there ain’t a man among ’em wouldn’t die
for you, and feel happy if you paid him with a smile.</p>

<p>“I’m going to let you think about this. Think it
over for a time, and carefully. We’re not such a bad
lot. We do our robbing and stealing boldly, and risk
our lives. Other men steal and rob under cover&mdash;by
giving short weight, cheating their customers, stealing
from the bank depositors and covering it up with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
lying figures, and in a thousand other ways; and the
world thinks such fellows are great stuff. They’re
thieves as much as we are here; but they’re cowardly
thieves, which makes them worse than we are. Many
a man that lives in a big house in the town and drives
his wife out Sundays in a shining carriage is a whole
lot more of a bad man than I am, and the world thinks
he’s fine as silk. It all depends on how you do the
stealing. Make the stealing respectable, and you’re
respectable. Steal boldly, and the penitentiary waits
for you.”</p>

<p>He rose from his seat by the door.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he said, as his hand fell on the knob
and he seemed about to go, “just think that over. I’ll
be good to you. I’m actually half in love with you,
and I’ll be wholly so if you’ll give me a chance.
You’re as handsome as a picture, and I like a pretty
woman. I’ll play fair by you, I’ll treat you well, and
you may have anything in the way of fine clothes or
other finery that you want.”</p>

<p>His brow darkened, as a new thought came to him.</p>

<p>“And understand that it’s just as well to do as I
say, and do it gracefully; for you can’t get away.
Accept my offer, and you’ll have no trouble. But
make trouble for us, and&mdash;well, you can see that we’ll
have to make trouble for you.”</p>

<p>He drew the door open and stepped through to the
outside, with his hand on the knob and on the key.</p>

<p>She saw that she could not escape by a wild rush,
and he seemed to read her thought.</p>

<p>“No, there ain’t no use tryin’ it, for you couldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
get away, even if you got out of this house. The entrance
to this valley is guarded, and there are the dogs.
They’re kind, unless we set them on the trail of somebody,
and then that somebody had better look out,
if the dogs overtake him. So don’t try. I’d hate to
have the dogs chew you up. Not but that you’d make
dainty eating for them; but I shouldn’t like it, <ins class="corr" id="tn271" title="Transcriber’s Note—“and for you it woudl” changed to “and for you it would”.">and for you it would</ins>
be mightily unpleasant.”</p>

<p>He started to lock the door, drawing it half shut.</p>

<p>“Think it over,” he urged. “I’m serious, and in
this game of robbery I’m not a hypocrite, but play the
game fair, and risk my life like a man in doing it.
Think it over. To be queen of Panther Pete’s road,
agents won’t be so bad as you may think. Take time
to study the situation. I’ll make you a good husband,
if you’ll give me the chance. And, if you don’t willingly,
I’ll be your husband anyway, and you’ll have
your trouble for your pains.”</p>

<p>He closed the door and locked it, and she heard his
footsteps as he departed.</p>

<p>Then she threw herself blindly on the floor, in a
very paroxysm of terror and anguish, sobbing. “I
must&mdash;must get away from here!” she cried. “I must&mdash;to-night&mdash;to-night!
Oh, I must get out of this
house!”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE RAIN MAKER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Panther Pete was not fool enough not to know that
there would be a pursuit of himself, although he hoped
that Bug-eye Slocum and his friend Nate Rainey
would be able to divert that pursuit in a wrong direction.</p>

<p>Yet he was taking no chances; so he sent back over
the various trails that led in the direction of Scarlet
Gulch what he called “stool pigeons,” clever members
of his road agent band, men whose shrewdness he
could rely on, and whose judgment and courage he
could trust.</p>

<p>It was the business of these men to draw any pursuers
into a certain trap&mdash;a peculiar place, rock surrounded,
not far from the hidden valley, where they
could be slaughtered readily by the road agents.</p>

<p>Bill Hatfield was one of the “pigeons,” and about
the shrewdest of the lot.</p>

<p>He had been sent out, and he had climbed into a
low, thick tree, after morning came, and from that
coign of vantage was watching the trail that stretched
in the direction of the town, expecting momentarily
to see in it something worth while. What he saw
after a time was Silas Deland and young Ben Denton.
They were mounted, but were coming on slowly, for
Denton’s wound made him weak. He was hollow-eyed
and pale; in this respect his face being in most
marked contrast with the red face of Deland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span></p>

<p>“’Tain’t Buffler Bill,” said the “pigeon” in the tree,
“ner anybody like him; but they’re from ther town,
and what they’re out hyer fer nobody don’t need ter
ask. So, I reckons, according to the order of ther
boss, it’s my duty to cut in, if I can.”</p>

<p>Yet he did not descend from the tree, but sat
crouched in the thick branches, watching the advance
of the pair.</p>

<p>When the horsemen reached the tree, which stood
on a little eminence, they halted, just under him.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’ll light down here a little while, and
rest ye,” said Deland kindly, glancing about and seeing
no signs of enemies.</p>

<p>“I believe that place is not far from here,” said
Denton. Though pale and weak, the fire of courage
and determination burned in his eyes and revealed
itself in his voice. “I’d like to push right on.”</p>

<p>“There aire more of our crowd, and our kind, out
here some’eres,” said Denton’s companion. “And I’m
fer signalin’ to them.”</p>

<p>“It will draw the attention of the road agents, if
they’re near.”</p>

<p>“Well, what if it does? I’d like to bring a little
rain. This country is more droughted up than the
desert of Sahiry. And that’s what brung me to Scarlet
Gulch, ye know, as I’ve been tellin’ ye, the droughty
condition out here. Says I to myself, ‘If I can go out
there and bring rain, it means the biggest kind of big
money in my pocket.’”</p>

<p>He had slipped from his saddle, and was helping
the young man to dismount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span></p>

<p>When Denton was on the ground, and had groped
his way weakly to the foot of the tree, where he
dropped down with a sigh of relief, Silas Deland
turned his attention to a “grip,” or hand bag, of queer
make, which he had hung at the horn of his saddle.
He set this on the ground by the tree; and then, dropping
down by the side of Denton, he opened it.</p>

<p>“I was tellin’ ye about that,” he said, “and about
the luck I had over in Arizony. Well, the land is that
dry and burned up in Arizony that men are compelled
to drink whisky because there ain’t water
enough to go round.”</p>

<p>He sprung open the bag, and within lay a number
of small, egg-shaped, white objects.</p>

<p>The spy in the tree craned his neck to see them, and
stared with popping eyes. At first he thought they
were eggs. But, when Deland took one of them out
and began to talk about it, the spy discovered his mistake.</p>

<p>“It’s this way,” said Deland, turning the white object
around in his fingers, handling it as gingerly as
if it were an egg and he feared to break it; “this land
out here is the driest part of creation. The last good
rain was, I reckon, when Noah had his flood and the
mountains became seas.</p>

<p>“It was funny”&mdash;he turned the egg-shaped thing
around in his fingers again&mdash;“the way them scalawags
humped when I pitched one of these things into the
midst of ’em there in Scarlet Gulch; they thought
they’d been dynamited.” He chuckled so much that
for a second or two he could not go on. “But it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
harmless&mdash;perfectly harmless&mdash;unless a man should
get some of the fire in his hair, or in his skin, or on
his clothing, and then it might burn him some. Otherwise,
it was perfectly harmless. But you saw it! And
did you ever see so small an object made so much fire
and smoke? And didn’t that gang of vigilantes fall
all over themselves in trying to get out of the way?
But perfectly harmless&mdash;perfectly harmless!”</p>

<p>The spy in the tree stared harder than before.</p>

<p>One of their members had been with the mob in
front of the Flash Light when the explosion came,
and he had told about it to the other members of
Panther Pete’s gang, narrating a wonderful story.</p>

<p>So the rascal in the tree knew what was meant by
the singular words of Silas Deland&mdash;knew quite as
well as did young Denton.</p>

<p>“It was strange,” Denton assented wearily.</p>

<p>It was plain he was not interested. He was thinking
of the perils of Ellen West, and was chafing at
what seemed an enforced and needless delay. He
wanted to be hurrying ahead, instead of resting there
under that tree.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard about my rain-making experiments?”
said Deland.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think that I have, except what you’ve
told me,” Denton answered.</p>

<p>Deland looked surprised and disappointed. He had
fancied that his fame had preceded him.</p>

<p>“Well, it was at White Cloud, Arizony, where I
made my biggest experiment. No rain there for nigh
about a year, and everything dry as a powder mill.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
There wasn’t a speck of cloud in the sky when I went
there. I says to the people of White Cloud, ‘Give me
a thousand dollars after it’s done, and I’ll bring you
all the rain you want inside of twenty-four hours.’”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at the sky, and then pointed
a finger, seeming to the spy in the tree to be pointing
straight at him.</p>

<p>“Looky there now! When I set off that bomb in
the crowd before the Flash Light, there wasn’t a cloud
as big as a man’s hand anywhere in sight. I’ll leave
it to you if there was.”</p>

<p>“No, there wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“And now, look at the sky&mdash;all covered over with
clouds; and it will sure rain inside of twenty-four
hours, especially if I set off some more of ’em. I think
I’ll turn this one loose; it will signal to our friends,
maybe, and bring ’em to us; and it will bring rain to
fill up some of these hollers, so that we’ll have water
fer ourselves and our horses, and won’t be in danger
of thirsting ter death before we get back.” He toyed
with the little bomb. “What do ye say?”</p>

<p>“I’m too tired to form an opinion,” Denton answered.</p>

<p>“Well, we need help, and that’s a fact. We don’t
know where we’re goin’. We’re jes’ amblin’ along,
trustin’ to luck. Luck is a good thing, but some other
things aire better. This is.” He patted the egg-shaped
thing. “So, if you don’t object, I think I’ll
touch her off.”</p>

<p>“The road agents are as likely to see it and come
as our friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll keep our eyes open. And there’s one thing:
If any road agents aire drawn by it, we kin keep out
of sight of ’em; and then we can trail ’em, and by
trailin’ ’em we’ll find where their hotel is out here;
and we’ll be close, then, to the place where they’re
holding the young lady.”</p>

<p>This was to Ben Denton the most convincing argument
of all.</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” he said wearily.</p>

<p>He sat against the tree, his hat pulled over his eyes,
his whole appearance showing that he was on the
verge of exhaustion.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Deland, “here she goes. But this
is a different kind from that I throwed in the street.
This kind you touch off like a rocket, by lighting this
end, when it shoots up into the air. You’ll be surprised
when you see it go. It’s my own invention; all
of ’em aire. And I think I’ve hit on a thing that’s
goin’ to make my fortune.”</p>

<p>The spy in the tree had grown so interested in all
this that he had nearly forgotten what he was there
for.</p>

<p>He saw Deland set the small white object on its
large end, on the ground; and then he saw him light
a match and touch the lighted match to the sharp, or
upper, end. Almost instantly there was a flash and
a roar.</p>

<p>Something that was blazing bright shot by him with
a whistling screech, so alarming and astonishing him
that he emitted a yell, and fell headlong out of the
tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span></p>

<p>The bomb sailed on into the sky, sputtering like a
rocket, as the “pigeon” struck the ground.</p>

<p>Though Deland and Denton were both astonished
by this tumble of the man out of the tree, they were
not too surprised to act promptly. Deland sprang on
the man, and bore him backward to the ground, as the
fellow tried to rise. He yelled for Denton to come
to his aid, and this Denton did with such alacrity that
he seemed not to be very weak, after all.</p>

<p>As for the spy, the fall had knocked the breath out
of him. This, with his astonishing tumble from the
tree, and the thing that had preceded it, made him an
easy victim. Almost before he knew it, Deland had
him by the throat and was choking him, and the
younger man was also throwing himself on him, helping
to hold him down.</p>

<p>The rockety thing that had flashed into the sky exploded
there, emitting a big puff of white smoke that
sprayed out and began to form what was in shape a
small cloud.</p>

<p>“Let up!” the spy gurgled, as he felt Deland’s fingers
dig into his throat.</p>

<p>However, Deland did not let up until young Denton
had secured one of the horsehair lariats, and from
it had made cords and bound the prisoner.</p>

<p>By this time the “pigeon” was almost black in the
face and half senseless.</p>

<p>Deland turned his attention to the sky, and to that
floating smoke cloud, as soon as he could do so. Just
then a few drops of rain spattered in his upturned
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span></p>

<p>It was but a natural phenomenon, of course, but Deland
was ready to ascribe that spatter of rain to the
effect of his exploding rain bomb. He yelled with
glee, and stretched out his hands, calling on Denton to
witness that it had actually rained.</p>

<p>“Denton,” he cried, “if I should send up enough of
them things, I could drownd the world, same’s it was
in ther days of Noah. Did you notice that beautiful
sprinkle?”</p>

<p>Denton was paying attention to the prisoner.</p>

<p>The spy gurgled and coughed, wriggled about, but
was helpless. Then he recalled that bright thing which
had startled him by flashing with a hissing roar past
his face, and his tumble out of the tree. He lay back
on the ground, groaning. Then his face brightened,
for he realized that he had not played in such bad
luck, after all.</p>

<p>The command of Panther Pete was for him to intercept
one of the pursuing parties, let that party capture
him, and then offer to lead it to the hidden home
of the outlaws; when Panther Pete would have a
force ready to wipe the said pursuers out.</p>

<p>Deland came back from the clouds, and gave some
attention to his prisoner.</p>

<p>“Who aire ye, and what was you doin’ there in the
tree?” he demanded; a thing which Denton had demanded
already.</p>

<p>“I’m Bill Hatfield,” confessed the rascal, sure they
had never heard his name before. “I’m a peacerble
citerzen.”</p>

<p>“What was you doin’ in that tree?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span></p>

<p>“Come!” cried Denton, and he produced a revolver.
“I know who you are, all right. You’re not from the
town, and that’s proof to me that you’re one of
Panther Pete’s men. Admit it, or I put a bullet
through you.”</p>

<p>Hatfield squirmed; then said, with seeming reluctance:</p>

<p>“Well, what you goin’ to do about it? I am one
o’ them fellers, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah, I knew it! And you were doing what, up in
that tree?”</p>

<p>“I seen ye comin’, and jest shinned up there ter
keep ye frum seein’ me. And say”&mdash;he turned to Deland&mdash;“what
was that thing you shot at me, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“That was a rain bomb,” said Deland proudly.
“Young man, I didn’t shoot it at ye, but you were
permitted to see then a marvelous exhibition; an effort
to bring rain from rainless clouds, and a successful
one, too; for, see!” He held out his hand. “It’s
sprinkling; and it’s been dry as a bone in this country
since about the year one. Now, ain’t that so?”</p>

<p>Denton still held the revolver ready cocked, and
again he pointed it at the rascal’s head.</p>

<p>“You know where Panther Pete has his lair. You’ll
tell us, or down you go.”</p>

<p>The rascal wriggled and squirmed. Yet this was
the thing he wanted.</p>

<p>“I don’t dare to tell,” he protested.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“’Cause Panther Pete would kill me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span></p>

<p>“And I’ll kill you if you don’t. So there you are.
Take your choice.”</p>

<p>There was a strange flush of excitement on the face
of Denton, and a bright and staring light in his eyes.</p>

<p>Hatfield saw that in his present mental condition
Denton was not a man to fool with.</p>

<p>“I’ll shoot you, sure,” said Denton, “if you don’t
tell me promptly where Panther Pete is.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;” Hatfield stammered, a bit terrified.</p>

<p>“Out with it!”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t tell you, but I might lead ye to&mdash;to the
place.”</p>

<p>“That’s as good.” Denton turned to Deland.</p>

<p>“It’s sprinklin’,” said Deland joyfully, “by all the
frogs of Egypt, it’s actually sprinklin’, and in this
country where&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Deland, did you hear what he says? That he will
guide us to the lair of Panther Pete?” He pointed the
pistol again at the head of the prisoner. “Another
question,” he said: “Is there a young lady held prisoner
there?”</p>

<p>The spy again hesitated.</p>

<p>“Out with it!” shouted Denton.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;yes, there is.”</p>

<p>“It’s the young lady, is it, who was taken last night
from Scarlet Gulch&mdash;Miss Ellen West?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know her name,” said the spy, “but it’s
her; for she was brought from that town.”</p>

<p>“And she’s in that place now, held there by Panther
Pete?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span></p>

<p>“You’re right. Anyway, she’s there, in one o’ the
houses.”</p>

<p>“So they’ve got houses there!” He turned to Deland
again. “Get the horses ready, Deland, and this
fellow is to be put on mine. I’ll sit behind him, and
make him guide the horse and pilot us. And, if he
tries any treachery, I’ll shoot a hole through him.”</p>

<p>His voice quivered. He was in deadly earnest.</p>

<p>“Correct ye aire,” said Deland, and he brought up
the horses.</p>

<p>“Now, I’m going to untie your feet, so that you can
get into that saddle,” said Denton; “but, if you try
to get away, I’ll pot you with this pistol. Understand?”</p>

<p>He cast off the cords that held Hatfield’s feet, and
the rascal mounted to the saddle agilely enough.</p>

<p>“Now, Deland, give me a lift.”</p>

<p>Deland gave him the “lift,” and Denton secured a
seat behind the prisoner.</p>

<p>“Now, Deland, tie his feet under the horse’s belly.”</p>

<p>Hatfield did not like this, but he could not help it,
for he had a healthy fear of that big revolver; and his
own weapons had been taken away from him.</p>

<p>Deland also mounted, and they were ready to start.</p>

<p>The smoke from the rain bomb had dissipated, but
there was a cloudy sky and a threat of rain.</p>

<p>“I’d like to fire off some more of the bombs, and
jest see what’d come of it,” said Deland wishfully.
“I’ll bet we’d have a flood before night, if I did. But
I ought to save ’em, I s’pose, to try fer rain down in
the town. That’s why I came there in the first place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
You can tell what an awfully dry country it is by
seeing the people hurry to the Flash Light.” He
laughed humorously, and studied the sky. “By Jove,
I’d like to try some more of them bombs!”</p>

<p>He had the “grip” at the saddle horn in front of
him as he thus rode forth.</p>

<p>Hatfield smiled to himself, with face turned away.
He was not pleased to be tied up so tightly, but he was
pleased by the fact that these men had commanded
him to lead them to the lair of Panther Pete. He was
leading them now toward the “trap” in the rock-girt
hollow, where he knew Panther Pete would have
sharpshooting riflemen lying in ambush.</p>

<p>Those riflemen, he believed, would cut the riders
down with bullets, and he would be free again, and in
a very short time.</p>

<span class="fs70">A GIRL’S HEROISM.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When the first shock of fright and terror had passed
away, Ellen West began to consider her situation with
more calmness.</p>

<p>The feeling that she must escape was so strong that
she searched the little hut carefully, trying to discover
some method of breaking out.</p>

<p>It would not have resisted the efforts of a good burglar,
but it was built too strongly for her to make any
breach in the walls or door.</p>

<p>She studied the floor of hard-beaten earth, wondering
if she could not tunnel under the walls. With this
thought in view she inspected the little table. Finally,
she tried to break the table up, hoping to get a substitute
for a spade from one of the boards.</p>

<p>She succeeded in breaking off one of the table legs,
but that was as far as she could go in demolishing the
table.</p>

<p>The table leg made a good club, but a poor digging
implement. In despair she began to try to claw a hole
under the wall with her fingers; but made such poor
progress that she desisted after a time, breathless and
discouraged, although she still was resolved to get out,
and to get out before the return of the human fiend
who had captured her.</p>

<p>Making the round of the room again, and studying
it by the light of the lamp burning on the floor&mdash;she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
had placed it there when she took it from the table&mdash;she
observed that over the door was a projection of
the upper door ledge. Back of that was a small space,
where the stout logs fell away, making a sort of
cranny, or cupboardlike hole, over the door and under
the roof.</p>

<p>She wondered if, by reaching that, she could not
with the club poke a hole in the roof, and so get out
that way.</p>

<p>She drew the broken table up by the side of the
door, and, mounting it, she reached up and took hold
of the door ledge. To get up into that cranny would
require the exertion of all her strength and climbing
skill.</p>

<p>She made the attempt, holding in one hand the table
leg; and, in doing so, overturned the table, and for a
moment or so hung suspended there by her hands.</p>

<p>But she drew herself up pluckily, and by gaining a
foothold in some inequalities of the wall she, with
great exertion, climbed up to the ledge. Having
gained the cranny, she dropped down, breathless and
nearly exhausted.</p>

<p>Before she had sufficiently regained her strength to
attack the roof with the table-leg club, she heard footsteps
outside, sounding like the footsteps of Panther
Pete.</p>

<p>If he came into the house, she felt that she was lost.
He would at once see the broken and overturned table,
and find her above the door, and would drag her down
and take steps to prevent her escape.</p>

<p>The thought nerved her to desperation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span></p>

<p>She heard him come up to the door, and heard him
fumbling with the key in the lock.</p>

<p>In very desperation she crouched above the door,
holding the club.</p>

<p>The door flew open, and he started to enter the
room.</p>

<p>She steeled her nerves and summoned all her
strength. Then, quick as a flash, and before he could
do anything, she brought the table-leg club down on
his head with all her might.</p>

<p>The blow was a heavy one, and, without a moan or
a groan, Panther Pete fell forward into the room,
lying in a heap just where he fell.</p>

<p>The girl almost collapsed with horror at the deed
she had done; but she saw that now was her time to
escape, before this deed was discovered by his followers,
or he returned to consciousness, if she had not
killed him.</p>

<p>She feared she had killed him, he lay so still.</p>

<p>The thought held her, trembling, for a full minute
on the ledge. Then she climbed down, stumbling
against him as she half fell to the floor.</p>

<p>He moaned and moved, and this so frightened her
that she sprang through the doorway to the outside.</p>

<p>She still held the club; but she was too frightened
to stop and close the door, or put out the light. All
she could do was to run; and she ran as fast as she
could, with trembling limbs, straight away from the
horror of that hut.</p>

<p>She saw other huts not far off, and from the window
of one a light gleamed. She thought she heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
men talking, and the bark of a dog, yet she hardly
knew what she saw or heard, the horror of the thing
she had done so filled and terrified her.</p>

<p>To her mind, it was an awful thing to take a human
life, even the life of such a man as Panther Pete. So
she ran on blindly, almost heedlessly, yet somehow
managed to avoid the other huts, and was not observed
by either the men or the dogs.</p>

<p>Soon she found herself close up by a wall of rock
that formed part of the rocky hill on that side.</p>

<p>As she could not climb over the hill, she ran on
along its base.</p>

<p>This hill formed one side of the little valley containing
the lair of Panther Pete, and as she followed on
she was taken toward the narrow entrance, where, as
she knew from his words, guards were stationed.</p>

<p>She thought of this as she stumbled on, and slowed
her pace, trying to become wary, and listened for some
sound which would tell her where the guards were located.</p>

<p>Every moment she expected to hear a clamor behind
her, announcing the discovery of her flight from
the hut and the condition of Panther Pete.</p>

<p>When she thought of what a pursuit by the dogs
meant, she could hardly hurry on at all, so weak did
that thought make her. But the discovery of Panther
Pete was delayed, and she continued to advance along
the base of the hill toward the entrance.</p>

<p>As she approached it, she recalled its shape, for
through it she had been brought. It was like the neck
of a bottle, the valley forming the bottle. High walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
were on either side, and the bottle neck was the pass,
guarded by sentries probably stationed in the trail,
and by others watching on the sides of the walls.</p>

<p>The darkness aided her. She grew more and more
cautious, and was able after a time to control her
shaking nerves and her fear-wrought fancies, when a
pursuit by the dogs and the outlaws was not made.</p>

<p>She saw before her the narrow opening, the sky
above making the upper parts of the walls visible.</p>

<p>She crouched low, and almost crawled forward, her
listening strained to the utmost tension.</p>

<p>She tried to subdue her hurried breathing, and
realized that to do so she must go very slow, and so
permit herself to regain breath. At times she seemed
hardly to move at all, as she kept close by one of the
dark walls, seeking the deepest shadows for security.</p>

<p>She saw no guard, yet was sure they were there.</p>

<p>Perhaps for the reason that the sentries did not expect
any one to come from the valley, and therefore
were directing all their attention to the front, where
if danger came it would be in the form of pursuers,
she passed the sentinels on the walls without being
seen, and also came close up to the one who was stationed
down in the pass.</p>

<p>Luckily she saw this man, for he was moving about,
his gun on his arm.</p>

<p>She dropped to the ground as if dead when she discovered
him, and lay there studying the situation, wondering
how she was to get by without discovery.</p>

<p>She saw that he walked a beat like a sentinel, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
one wall to the other, and that always, when he looked
at all, he looked toward the outer entrance.</p>

<p>When she had discovered this, she waited until he
turned to walk toward the opposite wall, and then
crawled on with the utmost care. She meant to spring
to her feet and make a wild dash to pass him if he
saw her.</p>

<p>When he had reached the opposite wall, and before
he turned, she was lying flat on her face, and could not
be seen by him.</p>

<p>As she made a second advance it brought her so
near to him that, when he returned, she was within
two yards of him.</p>

<p>She was almost sure he could hear her breathing
and the heavy beating of her heart; for both sounded
to her very loud. But he turned back again, toward
the other wall.</p>

<p>She crawled on, and was beyond him when he came
back.</p>

<p>When she made her next advance and stopped, she
was well beyond him.</p>

<p>Then came a terrifying thing.</p>

<p>The discovery of her escape was announced by low
calls from the huts, and by the hurried tramp of feet.
Men were rushing about in there, and she knew what
it meant.</p>

<p>The guard heard the sound, and turned his attention
to the valley.</p>

<p>“What’s broke loose?” she heard one of the sentries
ask on the wall.</p>

<p>She crept on, snaillike, it seemed to her, hugging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
the ground. Then she heard the dogs being called,
and their baying, as they began to search for her trail.</p>

<p>One of the guards on the wall voiced his disapproval
of this move.</p>

<p>“I dunno what the boss is thinkin’ ’bout, makin’ sech
a racket! That row kin be heerd a mile.”</p>

<p>The girl took advantage of the talk that followed to
slip on a short distance. She discerned that the confused
sounds of the men and the dogs were coming
toward the pass, and regardless of the guards, who
were still near, she rose to a more erect posture, and
stole on along the wall, keeping well within the
shadows. Soon she was running; and, as she got
farther on, she ran the faster.</p>

<p>Then before her opened the more open country,
which gave a better light, and she realized that she
had got through the pass and was outside of the hidden
valley.</p>

<p>It gave her hope. Only a terrible fear of those
mouthing dogs clung to her, and this fear made her
run on and on.</p>

<p>As soon as she was able, she shifted her course, and
climbed the high ridge on that side. She stumbled
and slipped, and more than once fell; but the courage
of fear kept up her strength and sent her on.</p>

<p>When she gained the top of the ridge, the valley lay
below her and the pass also, both dark as pockets.
She could see nothing down there, but above her the
stars shone brightly, and the light on the high ridge
was good enough to enable her to see her way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span></p>

<p>She was breathing hard, and trembling; but her determination
to escape was in no wise abated.</p>

<p>Then she began the descent, knowing not what was
before her, although behind her she knew were those
dogs and outlaws, and perhaps the dead body of
Panther Pete.</p>

<p>She shuddered at that, and at the recollections conjured
up by his name, and the recollections of the time
when she had believed him to be Buffalo Bill. And
she thought of her father, and of her lover, Ben Denton.
It should be said that she thought of Denton continuously.
Fortunately for her peace of mind, she
did not know that he had been shot down in the town
by Panther Pete.</p>

<p>By the time she had descended from the high ridge,
her clothing was torn, her hands scratched, and her
shoes were becoming ragged; but still she kept on.</p>

<p>Then, to her alarm, she heard the dogs more distinctly.
They <ins class="corr" id="tn291" title="Transcriber’s Note—“seeemed to have gained” changed to “seemed to have gained”.">seemed to have gained</ins>
the top of the ridge, and their loud baying rang out.</p>

<span class="fs70">ANOTHER STOOL PIGEON.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill had gained the Blue Hills
in the region of Panther Pete’s stronghold.</p>

<p>They had escaped from the vigilantes in a manner
that was not even yet clear to them, for they had no
present means of discovering who threw the bomb
which gave them the opportunity to get away from
the mob. Whoever he was, they felt grateful to him,
and called him their friend.</p>

<p>As their purpose was to hunt down Panther Pete as
soon as they were safely out of the town, they shaped
their course in the direction of the hills where, as they
had previously learned, Panther Pete had a stronghold.</p>

<p>It seemed a blind attempt to locate it, for the Blue
Hills were of large area. However, the daring scouts
had more than once set out with less to guide them in
their efforts to run down some desperado, and had succeeded.</p>

<p>They were sure that a pursuit would be made from
the town, and they knew that, if hard pressed, the Blue
Hills would give them refuge, as well as it gave
Panther Pete.</p>

<p>As they rode on, both mounted on one horse, they
discussed Panther Pete and what they had heard of
him, and the singular fact, as it seemed to them, that
both had appeared at about the same time in Scarlet
Gulch, led by the same motive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span></p>

<p>They pitched camp in the borders of the Blue Hills,
and awaited there the coming of day.</p>

<p>Sunrise was no more than upon them when they
beheld a man who had set forth to find and misguide
the pursuers of Panther Pete; a man who was one of
the “stool pigeons” already described.</p>

<p>This man came up to them, riding a piebald pony.
He had keen black eyes that bored them through and
through. His clothing was nondescript, but the rifle
he bore and the revolvers he carried were of the best
and latest patterns.</p>

<p>“Howdy!” he said, and he looked Buffalo Bill
straight in the face, knowing at a glance who he was,
for the resemblance to the man who was his leader
was remarkable. “I been lookin’ all round fer ye,”
he added, with rare confidence and nerve.</p>

<p>The scouts were a bit puzzled.</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Buffalo Bill. “And now that you’ve
found us?”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t know what orders you might have
fer the boyees.”</p>

<p>He was making the daring pretense of believing
that this man was the fake Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill dropped a hand to his ready revolver.</p>

<p>“Who do you take me for?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Buffalo Bill, o’ course,” said the man, with a meaning
grin.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s my handle, as we say in this country;
but I don’t seem to know you.”</p>

<p>The man opened his eyes in professed surprise.
“Don’t know me? Me&mdash;Sam Garland? I reckon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
you’ve got a sudden trouble of yer head, if ye don’t
know me.”</p>

<p>He stopped, and made a pretense of staring harder
and in astonishment. His acting was really excellent,
so excellent that it fooled even the clever scouts. Suddenly
he wheeled his horse, jerking it round.</p>

<p>“Stop!” Buffalo Bill shouted, snatching his revolver.</p>

<p>The man pulled in with a jerk that threw his horse
well back. “Don’t shoot!” he yelled. Again his acting
was astonishingly clever.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” Wild Bill commanded, covering the
fellow with a revolver.</p>

<p>“Yes; don’t shoot!”</p>

<p>The man sat trembling in his saddle, his actions still
being but a clever pretense; he was one of the best
of Panther Pete’s “stool pigeons.”</p>

<p>Wild Bill caught the bridle of his horse.</p>

<p>“Dismount!” Buffalo Bill commanded.</p>

<p>The man slid from the saddle.</p>

<p>“Now, I’ve got you covered, and shall bore you
through if you start to run,” said the scout.</p>

<p>“And I’ll bore you through, if you don’t talk lively
and give some straight answers,” added Wild Bill.</p>

<p>“Yes; don’t shoot!” begged Garland, in professed
terror.</p>

<p>“You thought I was the fellow who is riding about
this section claiming to be Buffalo Bill?” said the
scout.</p>

<p>The man hesitated. He knew he had to steer carefully
now; a false movement might mean his death.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “that’s what I thought.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span></p>

<p>“And that man is Panther Pete?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll inform you that I’m the real Buffalo Bill.
And, if your leader looks enough like me to fool even
one of his own men, I shall begin to be ashamed of my
personal appearance, for I understand he’s one of the
worst desperadoes of the border.”</p>

<p>Garland did not answer this.</p>

<p>“How far is Panther Pete’s home from this place?”</p>

<p>Garland hesitated; not because he did not know, but
to pretend a hesitation he did not feel.</p>

<p>“Speak up!” commanded Wild Bill tartly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know jes’ how far,” said Garland.</p>

<p>“You could lead us to the place, of course?”</p>

<p>“Y-es, I&mdash;guess I could.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have you do that. You’ve just come from
there?”</p>

<p>“Y-es.”</p>

<p>“Bear in mind,” said Wild Bill, “that, if any trickery
is played, you’ll be dropped first thing with a bullet
through you. There will be no fooling.”</p>

<p>Garland’s face paled a little. These men had a
reputation for being quick and sure shots, and he
knew the danger he had placed himself in. Then his
nerve returned.</p>

<p>“If I’m shot,” he said, “it will be by some o’ ther
boyees, or by ther boss, fer betrayin’ ’em, I’m
thinkin’.”</p>

<p>They tied his hands, and then compelled him to
mount to the back of his horse.</p>

<p>Wild Bill mounted behind him, and Buffalo Bill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
tied the feet of the rascal together under the horse’s
belly.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a horse apiece now, old pard,” said Wild
Bill, laughing. “I didn’t think we’d stay long without
mounts for both of us. Now, heave ahead, Sam.
And, mind you, no trickery. We won’t stand it.”</p>

<p>Garland indicated the direction to be taken, which
he claimed was the right direction to Panther Pete’s
stronghold. In reality the direction he pointed out
was that toward the “trap” into which the “stool
pigeons” were instructed to decoy pursuers.</p>

<p>So they rode along, with Garland and Wild Bill
leading the way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.<br />
<span class="fs70">THE CAPTURE OF PANTHER PETE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Panther Pete was not dead.</p>

<p>The sturdy blow of the girl had felled him, and he
had fallen insensible to the earthen floor, and there
he lay for some time as unconscious as a log. For the
girl had struck hard, and she had struck true, though
her strength did not enable her to deliver a blow of
skull-cracking force.</p>

<p>Panther Pete came back to consciousness, and himself
discovered that the girl was gone, and that the
door of the hut stood wide open. The discovery
stirred him into renewed life.</p>

<p>He crawled out of the hut and called for aid; and,
when he gained the attention of some of his men, he
berated them in hard language for their inattention,
which had enabled the girl to escape thus from the
hut, and pass, as she had done, almost through the
midst of the camp.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that the outcry was raised
which the girl heard as she fled away through the pass
toward the more open country beyond.</p>

<p>Panther Pete staggered into his own hut, and took
down from a shelf a bottle of whisky, from which he
drank, tipping it to his lips, and drinking deep and
long.</p>

<p>The fiery stuff brought back his strength somewhat,
and put a furious courage into his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span></p>

<p>The top of his head had a lump on it that was swelling
fast, and felt as big as a goose egg; but, when one
of his men examined the place, they could not find
that the skin had been broken.</p>

<p>But the blow had given him a terrific headache; he
said he felt as if the top of his head was caving in;
and now and then, as he tried to hurry about, and
ordered others to hurry, he staggered, as if the liquor
had already taken effect in his legs and had made
them wabbly.</p>

<p>However, he ordered up his horse; and then followed
the pursuers, whom he had sent on ahead, and
who were trailing the girl with the dogs.</p>

<p>Panther Pete disliked to use the dogs, for their
baying could be heard a long distance, and, if so heard,
might guide to the place persons whom he would
rather not see there. He knew that his position was at
the time peculiarly perilous. Friends of the girl could
be expected to make an immediate search for her; and,
besides, Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill, he felt sure, were
now in that section, with designs against him. For
this reason, after the dogs had gone on a while, and
then had begun to bay louder, he called them off, lest
the baying should reach farther than he wished. He
wanted to recapture the girl, but he desired his own
security even more.</p>

<p>This withdrawal of the dogs, though not understood
by the girl, came as a blessed relief to her, just at a
time when she was on the point of despair. They had
gained the top of the ridge, and were hot on her trail,
with their loud bellowing puncturing the night air in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
a way to carry terror to her very soul. Then suddenly
their deep booming ceased, and was no more
heard.</p>

<p>She fancied they had lost the trail, and had turned
in a wrong direction; and, with a prayer of thankfulness,
she hastened on again, her feet now torn and
bleeding and her strength fast giving way.</p>

<p>Panther Pete led that night pursuit of the girl as
well as he could; and he cursed her and himself with
fiery anger, calling himself a fool for being so kind
to her and so careless, and calling her by epithets she
would have blushed to hear.</p>

<p>When daylight came this pursuit was still being carried
on, but it had lost its first force, and was conducted
by the men as an almost aimless search of the
country close about the entrance to the hidden valley.</p>

<p>After the sun rose Panther Pete took it up again
himself, giving earnest orders to his men, and instructions
as to how to use the dogs. Then he set forth
alone, looking for the trail in what he thought the
most likely places, following along the narrow path
that led directly away from the valley entrance.</p>

<p>This took him by and by across the trail which led
from the outer plains toward the “trap” where his
sharpshooters were at the moment in hiding and to
which his “stool pigeons” were at the time conducting
the men whom they had fallen in with&mdash;Buffalo Bill
and his pard, and young Denton and Silas Deland.</p>

<p>The scouts with their prisoner were coming along
that trail, guided by Garland. They were wide awake
and wary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span></p>

<p>Garland had undertaken as difficult a thing as he
had ever attempted, in trying to lead these experienced
plainsmen into that trap.</p>

<p>At intervals Buffalo Bill rode his horse to the top
of some hill or ridge, and from these higher elevations
surveyed the surrounding country with his field glass.
While thus engaged, he beheld a horseman, some distance
away.</p>

<p>When he leveled the glass on this horseman, he was
given a genuine surprise, for the man was Panther
Pete, and he resembled the scout in his general appearance
and make-up so strongly that Buffalo Bill knew
he was looking on his counterpart&mdash;on Panther Pete,
the rascal who had played his desperate game so successfully
that for a long time he had deceived the
whole country as to his real identity.</p>

<p>The scout’s anger rose as he looked at that man.
Then he came to the quick determination to capture
the rascal, if it could be done.</p>

<p>He moved back, and, dismounting, tied his horse;
then crept forward.</p>

<p>He noted the course Panther Pete was taking, and
saw that he would pass along a thread of trail that led
beneath some bluffs not far off.</p>

<p>The scout drew back, and then, descending, he hurried
to put himself on top of those bluffs.</p>

<p>By this time Panther Pete was quite near, coming
on at an easy jog of his horse. There was nothing in
his appearance to tell of the pain he suffered, for his
head was throbbing, nor of what he had gone through,
nor of what he was now trying to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span></p>

<p>But Buffalo Bill saw his chance, a desperate one,
and made ready for it, crouching on the bluff. He
could have shot Panther Pete without difficulty, but
he did not want to do that; he wanted to take him
alive.</p>

<p>When Panther Pete’s horse passed beneath him,
Buffalo Bill crouched for the spring.</p>

<p>“I’ll stop your deviltry right now,” said the scout,
in a rage, as he leaped at the desperado whose clever
masquerading as his double had brought disgrace on
the honored name of Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>He hit the horseman fair, in that leap; and Panther
Pete went over sideways, out of the saddle, and fell
to the ground, with the dauntless scout falling on top
of him.</p>

<p>The horse gave a jump, and then ran, frightened by
what had occurred.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill set his fingers to the throat of Panther
Pete, who was too stunned by that sudden onslaught
and fall to make much resistance.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” was the sharp command.</p>

<p>Panther Pete tried to struggle, but he was helpless.</p>

<p>“Surrender!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I surrender!” the rascal gurgled in fright.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill lifted his revolver and fired it, for the
purpose of summoning Wild Bill; and soon after he
heard the clatter of Wild Bill’s pony&mdash;the pony that
had been the property of Garland.</p>

<p>They soon came in sight round the end of the hill&mdash;Garland
mounted in front and tied, and behind him,
on the same pony, Wild Bill, with revolver ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span></p>

<p>There was never a more astonished man than Garland,
when the pony had brought him under the bluffs,
and he saw there his leader, helpless and choking in
the grasp of Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>Wild Bill slid from the back of the pony and ran
to his pard’s aid.</p>

<p>“Just tie him, as quick as you can,” said Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>He released the villain’s throat, but held his revolver
before his eyes.</p>

<p>Wild Bill lost no time in complying. While doing
this, he was startled by hearing the clatter of the
pony’s feet.</p>

<p>Garland, thoroughly frightened now, had started
the pony, in the hope of escaping, even though tied.</p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>Wild Bill drew down on him.</p>

<p>“I can’t stop,” Garland yelled; “the pony is running
away with me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t, eh?”</p>

<p>Wild Bill yelled to the pony, commanding it to stop,
and saw Garland dig his tied heels into the pony’s side
to make it go on. His revolver cracked, and the pony
pitched over with a bullet in its head.</p>

<p>In its fall it pinned Garland’s leg under it, and held
him fast; so that, with the cords on him, he was in a
helpless position.</p>

<p>“Stay there a while,” said Wild Bill grimly, as he
turned back to aid Buffalo Bill in securing the robber
chief.</p>

<p>As they tied Panther Pete they marveled at his
cleverness, for they saw that his resemblance to Buffalo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
Bill was largely due to the clothing he had on,
to the manner in which he wore his hair and beard,
together with the fact that he was a large and tall
man.</p>

<p>Out of his eyes now looked terror; for he knew
who these men were, and he feared them with a
deathly fear.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE GIRL’S FLIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Ellen West, much relieved by the ceasing of that
terrible baying of the hounds, stumbled on through the
darkness, over the rough stones that cut her feet and
tore her clothing, filled with the hopeful assurance
that whatever befell her she was for the time out of
the power of Panther Pete and his gang of desperadoes.</p>

<p>By and by when she felt that she could go not another
step, being utterly spent, she sank down on the
ground.</p>

<p>About her was darkness and silence, with the kindly
stars looking down on her. Sometimes she wondered
if she were not dreaming, and would soon awake in
her own home and discover that all this was but a wild
nightmare. But the chill of the night air, after her
exertions, told her soon that it was all too real.</p>

<p>She crawled beneath an overhanging rock for shelter,
and there, after a time, she fell asleep.</p>

<p>She was so worn that she slept heavily, in spite of
all that had happened, and did not awake until the sun
was beating hot in her face. She aroused, with a start,
and looked about uneasily.</p>

<p>She saw that her clothing was torn and draggled,
and that her shoes were cut by the rocks, which had
also cut her feet. Her hands and arms, and her face,
were scratched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span></p>

<p>She started up, fearing pursuit; and then, seeing
nothing, and hearing nothing, she began to take stock
of her situation. It was bad enough, but so much better
than it had been that she felt hopeful.</p>

<p>She shuddered at the memory of Panther Pete lying
as if dead on the earthen floor of the hut, where she
had struck him down. But she could not blame herself
for that seemingly bloody deed; self-preservation
is the first law of nature, and she had acted according
to the law.</p>

<p>When she tried to go on she found that she was so
stiff and sore from her tremendous exertions that at
first she could hardly walk; but she forced herself to
move on, and this feeling began to wear slowly away.</p>

<p>She was conscious, too, that she was very hungry,
but there was nothing to eat, except some berries she
found growing by the trail. There was water in little
pools in the bottom of the shallow bed of the stream,
and there she drank. Then she went on again, shaping
her course by the sun as well as she could, hoping that
by steady walking she could by and by reach the more
open country, and so make her way back to Scarlet
Gulch.</p>

<p>But as she thus went on, and when everything
seemed to be in her favor, she heard again that horrible
baying of dogs. The outlaws, growing anxious,
or desperate, had decided to use the dogs again; and
had taken them to the place where, in the night, they
had been called off, and there had set them to work
once more.</p>

<p>As that baying broke on the air the startled girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
began to run, and again her heart throbbed with fear.
All her bright hopes came as suddenly to the ground
as a bird with a broken wing.</p>

<p>As she thus ran on, her limbs trembling and weak,
she saw in the path before her horsemen.</p>

<p>She thought they were some of the desperadoes of
Panther Pete’s band, and she turned aside, hoping
they had not seen her, or that she could in some way
escape them.</p>

<p>They rode toward her, shouting.</p>

<p>Terror shook her, for one of them seemed to be
Panther Pete himself.</p>

<p>She ran then as she had never run before.</p>

<p>The horseman came up to her, shouting to her.</p>

<p>When he was quite close on her, and she saw she
could not get away, she turned at bay.</p>

<p>Then she saw that this man was not Panther Pete,
though he so resembled him.</p>

<p>The man was Buffalo Bill, the noted scout; and he
rode up to her, doffing his hat, and spoke kindly to her.</p>

<p>She was so breathless, and so puzzled and startled,
that for a time she could not speak in answer to his
queries.</p>

<p>He announced his identity.</p>

<p>“I have a pard back here, and some prisoners,” he
said, “one of them being the notorious road agent,
Panther Pete.”</p>

<p>“Panther Pete?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“We captured him but a little while ago,” he said.
He looked at her earnestly and swung out of his saddle.
“I think you need this horse a good deal more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
than I do,” he declared. “You had better ride now;
you are quite worn out.”</p>

<p>She stood before him, trembling.</p>

<p>“You are not Panther Pete&mdash;cannot be!”</p>

<p>“I am William F. Cody,” he said, “better known
as Buffalo Bill.”</p>

<p>He lifted his head, listening to the baying of the
dogs.</p>

<p>“They are pursuing you, I think,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m here to see that they don’t harm you.
Will you please take my horse? I’ve an idea those
dogs belong to the outlaws that I know are in this
section. But we will see that they do not harm you.”</p>

<p>His assurance tended to dissipate her fears. She
stared at him with large eyes, that were still round
and terrified.</p>

<p>“I was held by Panther Pete, whom I used to think
was Buffalo Bill,” she stated; “and I escaped from
the hut he placed me in, over somewhere in that direction.
I thought I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He saw her reel with weakness.</p>

<p>“My dear young lady,” he said, putting forth his
hand to sustain her, “I must insist that you take my
horse, if you feel at all able to ride.”</p>

<p>She glanced at Wild Bill, who was approaching with
the prisoners, Panther Pete and Garland.</p>

<p>The clamor of the dogs broke louder on the air.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes,” she said, when she heard again that
terrifying sound. “I can ride.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill helped her mount to the saddle. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
was afoot now, and so was Wild Bill, for the latter
had mounted his two prisoners on the one horse, and
had tied them, and held them cowed with his revolver.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill glanced about. He knew that the dogs
were not alone, and that soon some of Panther Pete’s
desperate followers would be in sight, after which
there would probably be a lively battle, with the odds
probably against him and his pard.</p>

<p>He saw a hollow in the rocks just across the path,
not far away.</p>

<p>“We can put the horses behind the hill there,” he
said to Wild Bill, “and then we can get into that
pocketlike place, and by heaping up a sort of breastworks
make a stand so strong that we’ll trouble the
rascals, if no more.”</p>

<p>“Correct,” Wild Bill assented; “and I guess we’d
better move lively.”</p>

<p>They moved lively, and were soon in the hollow
spoken of, with the horses out of sight behind the rise
of the hill.</p>

<p>The prisoners were tied anew, and so securely that
there was little chance they could break away; and
the girl, who had been taken from the horse, was asked
by the scouts to watch them.</p>

<p>Then Buffalo Bill and his companion set to work to
roll some stones together in front of their hiding place,
and behind those stones they meant to take their stand.</p>

<p>Soon the dogs were in sight, baying, and came on,
following the tracks of the girl, with noses held close
to the ground. They were big brutes, three of them,
of ferocious aspect. Behind them appeared several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
horsemen, riding at a rapid pace, but not too fast for
the dogs.</p>

<p>It was clear that the girl would soon have been overtaken,
if she had not found friends to aid her.</p>

<p>She looked at the dogs with a shudder, realizing
what that pursuit had meant for her.</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened, my dear young lady!” said
Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>“But those men will attack you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we expect that; but it’s a game we can
play, also. They’ll find it warm when they try to get
at us here.”</p>

<p>“Aye, they will!” assented Wild Bill, as he looked
to his rifle and revolvers, and poked into them new cartridges.
“I’m opining there will be some dead men
decorating that trail in a very few minutes, if those
fellows come on.”</p>

<p>The men came on, with the dogs leading.</p>

<p>Then the dogs discovered the men and the girl in
the hollow of the rocks, and they charged, baying savagely.</p>

<p>“Here’s for dead dog meat!” said Wild Bill, with a
reckless laugh, as his revolver spouted its flame and
lead, and the foremost dog pitched over, rolling down
the hill.</p>

<p>The horsemen farther down the trail drew rein.</p>

<p>“Just come on!” said Wild Bill, speaking to them,
but in a low tone.</p>

<p>The other two dogs dashed at the barricade. One
rolled down hill, killed by Buffalo Bill’s bullet. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
other, frightened by that, retreated, and dashed back
up the trail, barking in a startled manner.</p>

<p>The horsemen dismounted, and began to confer.</p>

<p>There were six of them, but soon more appeared;
and then it became evident that still others were advancing,
along another trail that centered at this point.</p>

<p>The horsemen did not hesitate and confer long.
They took their horses back out of sight, and disappeared
themselves.</p>

<p>“They are gone!” said the girl.</p>

<p>“And will come back again,” said Wild Bill.</p>

<p>In a little while a rifle spouted from out of the
near-by hills, and the leaden missile whistled past the
girl’s head and struck the rock behind her.</p>

<p>“Down!” said Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>Another rifle flamed from another hill, and the lead
came into the hollow. The sharpshooters were beginning
their work.</p>

<p>They had located their quarry, and from eminences
that gave them range of the place they opened up
now, determined to slay the men who had taken
refuge there.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE FLAG OF TRUCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Deland and Denton, with their “stool-pigeon” prisoner,
were not far away when this battle opened up.</p>

<p>Hatfield was piloting them to that “trap,” where
he expected the sharpshooters would slay them. But
when he heard the crack of those rifles, he recognized
by the reports that they were the guns of some of
the men he had thought were in the “trap.” That
they were out there, firing, told him that something
had gone wrong.</p>

<p>“Hear that?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Denton; “what do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“Some kind of a fight, I reckon,” said Hatfield.</p>

<p>“You stay here, while I look into that, will ye?”
said Deland. “From the sound of it, I’m jedgin’ that
a battle is goin’ on that maybe we’re int’rested in, er
might git int’rested in.”</p>

<p>Denton did not like to remain behind. He had no
thought, though, that his sweetheart was over there
where that shooting was going on, for he did not
know where she was, except that he believed she was
held by Panther Pete; and Hatfield had been professing
to lead them to Panther Pete’s lair.</p>

<p>Hatfield looked uneasily in the direction of the firing.
Deland was disappearing in that direction. Denton
took out his revolver.</p>

<p>“Remember, no breaks!” he warned, when he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
the eager light in Hatfield’s eyes. “I’m licensed to
shoot you, if you try any.”</p>

<p>Deland rode straight toward the firing, until he
came within a comparatively short distance; and then
he concealed his horse in a thicket and crept forward
on foot, taking with him his precious “grip,” containing
the rain-making materials so dear to his heart.
He never let that out of his hands for long.</p>

<p>The outlaws had drawn together, finding one point
from which they could fire best down into the hollow
where Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill had taken concealment.</p>

<p>They could see nothing now but the rocks there, but
they were shooting, nevertheless, hoping to hit something.</p>

<p>Deland was able to take advantage of this, the attention
of the outlaws being drawn to that barricade
of stones; and he crawled close up to them, being
higher than they were, on the ridge behind them.</p>

<p>As he looked down he saw ten of the rascals, lying
there behind the rocks, with their rifles pointed down
at another group of rocks some distance below and
on the opposite side of the narrow trail.</p>

<p>As he thus looked over, exposing himself, a rifle
flamed in the barricade, and a bullet cut through his
hat. He dropped flat, with remarkable celerity.</p>

<p>“Great floods!” he gurgled. “That rifleman came
nigh gittin’ me. I’ll have to look out, or I’ll have my
precious skull perf’rated. Wonder who’s doin’ that
shootin’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span></p>

<p>It took him some time to make out; and he did not
thoroughly understand the situation until he saw one
of the outlaws walk out toward the barricade, waving
a white flag, and saw Buffalo Bill come forth to meet
him.</p>

<p>The outlaws had discovered that the scouts held
Panther Pete a prisoner, and they wanted to confer,
and negotiate for his release.</p>

<p>The bearer of the white flag had a proposition.</p>

<p>“Release Panther Pete, and we’ll stop our shootin’,”
he said, “and we’ll git out of the country. You can
keep the girl. Just give us up the prisoners you’ve
got.”</p>

<p>“How did you know who we’ve got?” the scout demanded,
somewhat surprised.</p>

<p>“One of us has got a field glass, and he saw Panther
Pete and t’others down here. Surrender ’em to us,
and we’ll cut out of this fight and leave the country.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill’s answer was a defiance.</p>

<p>“No,” he said; “come and get us!”</p>

<p>“We’ll wipe the whole of ye out, if you don’t surrender
’em,” the outlaw threatened.</p>

<p>“Proceed with the process,” said the scout. “We’ve
got Panther Pete, and a fellow whose name is Garland,
and we mean to hold them. If you want them
badly, come and get them.”</p>

<p>The outlaw retired, and was no sooner behind the
rocks than the sharpshooters opened again. But having
discovered that their leader was held there, they
were more careful, and their shooting did no damage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span></p>

<p>More men were coming, for the outlaws had sent
runners back to the camp, and these were hurrying up
reënforcements.</p>

<p>Deland, from his post of observation, saw the arrival
of these reënforcements.</p>

<p>“Great fish hooks!” he gasped. “This is ticklish
bizness, and I reckon it’s down in the bills for some
one to git hurt. Hope it ain’t goin’ to be me!”</p>

<p>Then he had an inspiration. He glanced at the sky,
gray and cloudy, as if threatening rain.</p>

<p>“Guess it’s time!” he said; “I reckon that this here
dry country is bad needin’ rain. I might try some
more rain-makin’ experiments, only I hate to waste
the material here that I intended to experiment with
down in the town. But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He opened the “grip” he had brought, and, as he
did so, heard a step behind him.</p>

<p>He turned, with one of the “bombs” in his hand,
intending to hurl it at any foe he saw there, and was
astonished to behold Denton.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stay back there,” Denton whispered.
“So I tied that villain, and came in, following you.
Something’s doing down there.” He glanced up the
trail. “Yes, and more men coming.”</p>

<p>“Buffalo Bill’s down there,” said Deland, “and
they’ve been trainin’ their batteries on him. I think I
seen the flutter of a woman’s dress down there, too,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ellen!” gasped Denton, immensely excited.</p>

<p>“I dunno. Seems as though it may be. And there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
comes more reënforcements; so they’s goin’ to be a
lively time round here mighty quick, and in the end
the folks down there will be killed, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“We must go to their aid!” Denton panted, his eyes
shining.</p>

<p>“Jes’ what I was thinkin’ o’ doin’! But don’t holler
’bout it and give ’em warning. See this here?” He
held up the “rain bomb.” “And ye see them men
down there?”</p>

<p>Denton nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, now you’ll see some fun, fer this ain’t ezactly
ther same kind as I fired into the crowd in the town.
This will wake ’em up.”</p>

<p>He lifted himself and hurled the bomb, with such
true aim and force that it struck right in the midst of
the hidden riflemen. There was a flash and a deafening
roar, and a blinding cloud of white smoke covered
everything.</p>

<p>Out of that white smoke men leaped, some of them
tumbling and falling, all thoroughly frightened.</p>

<p>When the smoke lifted, three of them were seen
dead on the ground, for the bomb this time had been
a genuine one.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” chuckled Deland. “When I chip into a
fight of this kind something’s happenin’ right off.”</p>

<p>The outlaws did not tarry there for their remaining
reënforcements; they fled, vanishing into the hills.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill and his companions were relieved thus
quickly of their enemies, and the big battle they had
anticipated was not fought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span></p>

<p>Down in the town of Scarlet Gulch, less than a week
later, Deland had an opportunity to try his rain-making
bombs. He claimed the benefit of the “shower” that followed.</p>

<p>Before that time Buffalo Bill had landed his prisoners,

<p>There is no more romantic character in American history than
William F. Cody, or as he was internationally known, Buffalo
Bill. He, with Colonel Prentiss Ingraham, Wild Bill Hickok,
General Custer, and a few other adventurous spirits, laid the
foundation of our great West.</p>

<p>There is no more brilliant page in American history than the
winning of the West. Never did pioneers live more thrilling
lives, so rife with adventure and brave deeds as the old scouts
and plainsmen. Foremost among these stands the imposing
figure of Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>All of the books in this list are intensely interesting. They
were written by the close friend and companion of Buffalo Bill&mdash;Colonel
Prentiss Ingraham. They depict actual adventures
which this pair of hard-hitting comrades experienced, while the
story of these adventures is interwoven with fiction; historically
the books are correct.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
